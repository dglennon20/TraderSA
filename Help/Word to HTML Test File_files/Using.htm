<h1>Using Trader Sentiment Analysis (TraderSA)</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed to go from
top to bottom in typical fashion with the user required to execute the desired
and required functions. In most cases, predecessor functions are included in
later functions where dependencies exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=355 height=445 id="Picture 1"
src="images/gui.png"></p>

<h1>Selecting Dependencies</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stock Symbol – This feature is intended to provide a list of
stock symbols that are available for analysis. Direct entry is not allowed.
Default to TSLA for version 1. Future versions will allow additional stocks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>News and Price Source - This feature is intended to provide
a list of stock news and price sources to which the system is configured to
draw upon. Direct entry is not allowed. Default to Stocknews.com for version 1.
Future versions will allow additional sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Find chromedriver.exe – The location of the chromedriver.exe
file will vary from one machine to the next. Press this button to select the
location of the chromedriver.exe file. If it is not on the machine, you will
have to download it first. If you have Chrome on your machine, it is most
likely on it. Selecting it is through the typical windows dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=624 height=452 id="Picture 2"
src="images/fileDialog.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Select Existing File – If you have an existing scored
database/CSV file that you want to use, this feature is for selecting that file
using the standard windows dialog box.</p>

<h1>Harvesting the Data</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Generate News-Price File – Selecting this will trigger the
SaveAs location where you will need to locate the place on your hard drive to
store the dataset/CSV file and the name of the file. After selecting the SaveAs
location, the application will begin harvesting the data and scoring the
sentiment of the news headline and body of the article. Once this completes the
file will be ready for follow on steps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Train Algorithm – Version 2 feature that will train the
algorithm or load a training state. This can take considerable time and thus
gets its own button as the effort needs to be deliberate. Once training
completes, the function will save the training set for later usage, but with
much quicker response. The result of training often provides an accuracy
measure due to the nature of the training process. That result will be
displayed in the Training Accuracy textbox.</p>

<h1>Correlation/Reporting</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Execute Correlation Test – Version 2 feature that will
correlate against the trained dataset to analyze the sentiment of the stock
heading and body text. It will also save the correlation to a dataset for
storage and later viewing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Report – Displays a graph report of the sentiment analysis
results with respect to price of the chosen stock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=624 height=406 id="Picture 3"
src="images/report.jpg"></p>

<h1>Supporting Features</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Help – Select this to bring up the help files for
information about the application, usage and installing. This is a standard
windows CHM file that can be loaded from within the application or from the CHM
file directly within Explorer or a command line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Close – Closes the application.</p>
