<h1>About</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Trader Sentiment Analysis Stock Predictor tool (<span
class=SpellE>TraderSA</span>) will track the news cycle on a chosen stock to
determine the best time to execute buy or sell orders. This effort will attempt
to expand the use of Stanford University’s Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools or equivalent by employing sentiment analysis to read the news and generate market
sentiment on a chosen stock to determine if this correlates with market
movement of the selected stock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>The main goal of this project is to identify if a correlation exists
between the news cycle and publicly traded securities using Machine/Deep
Learning. The product will aim to be used on any stock, but at first focused
only on Tesla (TSLA) and possibly, the top ten S&amp;P 500 most shorted US
companies. I endeavor to either answer the question, if correlation exists and if it is a
genuine reflection of financial risk, and if I can predict the direction of the
stock for financial gain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The project had lofty goals to use Recurrent Neural Networks
to perform a more accurate sentiment analysis, but had to be trimmed to using a
limited python library called <span class=SpellE>TextBlob</span>. <span
class=SpellE>TextBlob</span> served the purpose well and in version 2 [post-graduation]
the sentiment analysis function can be replaced by a more intensive sentiment
analysis tool.</p>
