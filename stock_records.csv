Tesla shares boosted 12 percent after the exciting earnings report. The company already possesses “driver assistance” available cars that can take care of some tasks but retains the need for drivers to hold the wheel.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has received a vote of confidence from JMP Securities in the form of an outperform rating. more
CNBC passes along the firm’s take on the electric vehicle maker.
JMP Securities gave Tesla shares a new outperform rating on Wednesday, citing the automaker’s collection of top talent and competition that continues to lag behind Elon Musk’s electric car manufacturer.
JMP’s message to buy Tesla comes hours before the company will report third-quarter earnings on an earlier date than expected.
JMP’s Joseph Osha provided insight in a note to clients. “Stretched balance sheet, but we think Tesla can make it. The combination of the Model 3 ramp, capital spending plans, and pending debt repayments have left Tesla in a difficult position,” Osha wrote. “Our detailed modeling suggests the company can make it through the next 18 months without having to raise money, but there is little room for error. We believe the company would be well served by raising several billion dollars in additional equity capital.”

Andrew Left has revealed that he is betting the stock will rise, and that he thinks it is the only company that can buy and sell electric cars. Left is simultaneously suing Tesla for an August 7th tweet by Elon Musk about taking the company private. Left claims Musk did this with the intention of manipulating stock prices.
CNBC provides details:
“Citron is long Tesla as the Model 3 is a proven hit and many of the TSLA warning signs have proven not to be significant,” said Left in a blog post Tuesday. “Plain and simple – Tesla is destroying the competition.”
“TSLA is not just pulling customers from BMW and Mercedes but also from Toyota and Honda. Like a magic trick, while everyone is focused on Elon smoking weed, he is quietly smoking the whole automotive industry,” the short seller added.
After an extremely volatile year, Tesla stocks got a boost in light of CEO Elon Musk’s settlement with the SEC.

Tesla cofounder Martin Eberhard originally came up with the idea in Disneyland’s Blue Bayou restaurant.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is taking advantage of its phasing-out tax credit by encouraging buyers to purchase its most expensive model.more
Tesla’s sophisticated electric cars are expensive to produce, and to turn a profit the company is using creative tactics to boost sales. A full, $7,500 tax credit is only available to consumers who order the vehicle by October 15th, to whom Tesla guarantees their vehicles will be delivers by the end of 2018.
The Motley Fool provides details:
However, many reservation holders may not be able to afford even the cheapest Model 3 variant currently in production. While there are hundreds of thousands of outstanding reservations, Tesla has been allowing nonreservation holders to order the Model 3 versions currently in production (essentially skipping the line) since July. Nevertheless, the lead time has shrunk to a maximum of four weeks for rear-wheel-drive models and eight weeks for dual-motor models.
Tesla’s Model 3 dual-motor all-wheel drive variants are more expensive than rear-wheel drive counterparts. Tesla hopes to boost sales of their most expensive vehicles by pressing consumers with the deadline.

However the company did deliver more vehicles in the third quarter than analysts expected. At the time, the automaker said production had stabilized.
The rate is holding strong despite the tendency for production to slow down at the end of the month. After years of struggling with production, Tesla created more vehicles than analysts expected last quarter.

The Financial Times has reported on who the new chairman of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), but CEO Elon Musk has basically said not so fast. Musk has taken to Twitter to dispute the report. more
CNBC has the news.
Outgoing Twenty-First Century Fox Chief Executive James Murdoch is the lead candidate to replace Elon Musk as Tesla chairman, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, but Musk in a tweeted reply to the newspaper said, “This is incorrect.”
Tesla has until Nov. 13 to appoint an independent chairman of the board, part of settlements reached last month between Tesla, Musk and U.S. regulators in the wake of Musk tweeting in August that he had secured funding to take the electric car maker private.
The Securities and Exchange Commission came down hard on Musk over his flippant tweets about potentially taking the company private. He’ll be allowed to stay in place as CEO, but a new chairman will need to be appointed. According to Musk, Murdoch is not the choice, although reports indicate he wants the gig.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has received safety perfect scores for its Model 3 car.more
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave perfect safety scores to the Model 3, and it even appears to score higher than average on statistics that are not usually provided by the federal government. Tesla posted a blog post which boasted a statistic from the NHTSA, making it “safer than any other vehicle.”
CNET provides details:
As for Tesla’s other two vehicles, the Model S and Model X, the news is almost as good. According to Tesla’s chart, its larger vehicles sit right next to the Model 3 on the probability-of-injury chart. Tesla’s image doesn’t name any runners-up from other automakers, although some vehicles appear to be pretty close.
It is unclear exactly how these statistic are acquired by the NHTSA, but Tesla’s repeated success in every subcategory grants consumers serious reason for confidence in the electric car manufacturer.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is showing similar signs to Lehman Brothers before its 2008 bankruptcy, according to analyst.more
Greenlight Capital president David Einhorn, who famously predicted the collapse of Lehman Brothers, sees dark times ahead for Tesla. Einhorn pointed to the way the electric car company deflects criticism and hides problems.
Market Watch provides a quote from the analyst:
“There are many parallels to TSLA,” Einhorn said. “In 2013, TSLA was on the brink of failure as customers who had paid deposits weren’t taking delivery of the Model S. TSLA’s cash reserves fell to a dangerously low level and CEO Elon Musk secretly and desperately tried to sell the company to Google. Rather than communicating truth to shareholders, Mr. Musk bluffed his way through the crisis. There were no regulatory, legal or market consequences for failing to own up to reality. The business survived, and Mr. Musk was celebrated for his successful bluffing.”
Musk’s success has emboldened him to continue being deceptive, according to Einhorn. After receiving a fine from the SEC last week, Musk sent out an indignant, provocative tweet, mocking the organization as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission.”

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sends another provocative tweet out shortly after settling with the SEC.more
Musk sent out a tweet Thursday saying, “Just want to that the Short seller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!” Ironically, the original issue was also caused by a tweet, in which Musk claimed he was taking the company private. The SEC sued Musk for the tweet, saying that it was misleading and caused major market disruption.
ZDNET provides details:
As part of the settlement, Tesla executives are meant to monitor Musk’s posts in the interest of the company and investors. If Musk continues on his one-man Twitter crusade, perhaps they will see a need for more firm action when it comes to the executive’s use of social media platforms — especially as these messages now have the power to impact the share price of the company.
Musk will retain his role as CEO, but must step down from chair and not seek reelection for three years, according to the agreement reached in the compromise.

Musk had recently sent an email to Tesla employees — posted on the company’s blog — in which he stated, “We are about to have the most amazing quarter in our history, building and delivering more than twice as many cars as we did last quarter.” That would have translated to producing more than 106,000 vehicles and delivering more than 81,000. It’s unclear whether Musk was referring to Q3 2018 or Q4 2018 — or, for that matter, Q1 2019 — as the quarter when this feat would occur. Tesla’s there on the deliveries but not on the production…at least, not yet.
CEO Elon Musk has failed to meet promises regarding the electric car company in the past, but it did meet ambitious quarterly production goals of its Model 3 and could theoretically make a profit if it continues to maintain its production rate. The company has proven to maintain high stock prices without profits, but they will be necessary as the electric car sector begins to become more competitive.
Tesla, Inc shares were trading at $281.83 per share on Thursday afternoon, down $12.97 (-4.40%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -9.48%, versus a 9.88% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-10-04,Moody’s Sounds a Warning on Trade Fears Affecting Tesla Inc's (TSLA) Bottom Line,3,294.80,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-moodys-sounds-a-warning-on-trade-fears-affecting-tesla-incs/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another company that could be impacted by a trade war between the United States and China. That’s the word from both J.P. Morgan and Moody’s, which have separately sounded the alarm of concern. more
CNBC has the details.
The escalating trade conflict between the U.S. and China could be bad news for Tesla, according to J.P. Morgan.
On Tuesday, Tesla cautioned investors about the “headwinds” in China from the trade war in its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries announcement. The company said the trade conflict has led to a 40 percent import tariff on Tesla vehicles exported to China.
In a note to clients,  J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman pointed out that the deliveries release speaks to challenges in China relative to the increase in tariffs for vehicles imported from the United States.” Moody’s analyst Bruce Clark expressed additional concerns in his research note.
“Cash generation could be dampened, however, by rising trade tensions with China,” he wrote. “China is an important long-term market for Tesla and exports to the country represented approximately 20% of automotive revenues during 2017.”
Tesla Inc shares fell $0.87 (-0.30%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.32%, versus a 10.75% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

There always seems to be an air of negativity surrounding Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and that makes it pretty tough to envision it becoming a trillion-dollar company down the road. Don’t tell that to Ron Baron, the billionaire founder of Baron Capital. more
CNBC passes along what Baron had to say.
Major Tesla shareholder Ron Baron told CNBC on Tuesday the electric automaker could be a $1 trillion company in revenue by 2030.
“I think it could be a $500 billion battery business, $500 billion car business. I give that better than 50-50 chance,” the billionaire buy-and-hold investor said.
Baron acknowledges that the vibe around Tesla would be better if CEO Elon Musk would ease up on his Twitter posting habits. However, he also notes that he believes the company is actually close to self-funding.
“I think this is going to be the biggest car company,” he said.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) hits its most impressive quarter in its history this quarter.more
After months of challenges concerning both supply chains and publicity Tesla, has achieved a very impressive quarter in regards to manufacturing. The automaker is expected to release its official numbers regarding production later today, but for now it appears the automaker has achieved its Model 3 goal with days to go.
Electrek provides details:
A source familiar with the matter has told Electrek that Tesla produced a record ~80,000 vehicles this quarter.
This level of production is unprecedented for the automaker, but deliveries could turn out to be even crazier.
Electrek also argued that Tesla’s intense end of quarter practice, while impressive, hurts customer service. Hopefully Tesla will achieve a more standardized production rate that alleviates extreme volatility in manufacturing.
Tesla, Inc shares were trading at $309.60 per share on Monday afternoon, up $44.83 (+16.93%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.56%, versus a 10.81% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-10-01,Professor: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Will Need to Find a Deal Partner at This Point,3,264.77,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-professor-tesla-inc-tsla-will-need-to-find-a-deal/,"
Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) never-ending troubles are going to continue to snowball, and that points to the company being bought out at some point. That’s the take from NYU professor Scott Galloway, who believes a pair of tech titans are natural suitors for the electric vehicle maker.   more
Galloway shares his thoughts on Tesla in a piece for L2.
Apple or Google are the most likely suitors, as the car is a platform of sorts, and one can see Apple employing their high-margin luxury brand, vertical distribution, and artisan strategy on Tesla.
Conversely, Google could also use the (car) platform as a means of jumping ahead on self-driving and serving up ads/info/media while in/on this platform. It says something bad about our economy when any industry digresses to iOS or Android. The valuation prohibits another auto firm from acquiring Tesla, as the markets assign a tech, vs. auto, valuation to the firm. Tesla shareholders (note: I do not have a long or short position in TSLA) are also about to start hating @elonmusk.
Galloway points to the company’s recent kerfuffle with the SEC and increased competition in the electric vehicle space as a pair of problems that could lead to major changes at Tesla.

2018-10-01,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Set for Early Pop Following CEO Elon Musk Settlement with SEC,3,264.77,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-set-for-early-pop-following-ceo-elon/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has apparently had a change of heart. Last week, he seemed intent on fighting the SEC fraud suit that was leveled against him. He thought better of that over the weekend, and the Tesla roller coaster is heading back up for the time being as a result.  more
CNBC has the details on Musk’s settlement.
The SEC charged Tesla with fraud alleging CEO Elon Musk issued “false and misleading” statements and failed to properly notify regulators of material company events. The charges were in relation to a tweet that Musk posted in August saying he was considering taking the electric carmaker public at $420 a share.
But on Saturday, Musk settled the charges with the SEC, agreeing to pay a civil penalty of $20 million and give up his role as chairman of the board for at least three years. The SEC also imposed a fine of $20 million on Tesla. The carmaker must also appoint two independent directors to the board.
Based on the terms of the deal, neither Musk or Tesla needs to admit to any wrongdoing. That puts a bow on the latest batch of Tesla drama, at least for the time being. We’ll patiently wait to see what the rest of the day brings.
Tesla Inc shares rose $49.93 (+18.86%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -14.96%, versus a 10.37% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s latest debacle has apparently come to an end.more
As Reuters reports, the embattled executive has reach a multimillion dollar agreement with U.S. regulators to settle a tweet-fueled dispute:
Tesla Inc and Elon Musk have agreed to pay $20 million each to financial regulators and the billionaire will step down as the company’s chairman but remain as chief executive, under a settlement that caps a tumultuous two months for the carmaker.
The securities fraud agreement, disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday, will come as a relief to investors, who had worried that a lengthy legal fight would only further hurt the loss-making electric car company.
The problem arose last month, when Musk tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share. “Funding secured,” he wrote in the blockbuster tweet that sent shares soaring.
Spoiler alert: funding wasn’t secured, and it’s unknown whether Musk ever seriously considered taking the company private to begin with.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $264.77 on Friday, down $42.75 (-13.90%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -14.96%, versus a 10.37% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares had their worst day in nearly five years on Friday, plunging almost 14% amid the SEC suing CEO Elon Musk.more
CNBC has more details on the landmark action against the electric automaker’s founder, and the potential fallout:
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk on Thursday, alleging for fraud. The complaint says Musk issued “false and misleading” statements and failed to properly notify regulators of material company events. Musk called the SEC’s allegations “unjustified” and said he “never compromised” his integrity.
Barclays believes if Musk is forced to leave because of the SEC action, it will be weigh on Tesla’s stock.
In fact, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note to clients that “The SEC civil action may lead to Musk’s exit from Tesla (either permanently or temporarily) and the Musk premium in the shares dissipating. Tesla shares have ~$130 of Musk premium for future success that might dissipate.”
Johnson rates TSLA as Underweight with a $210 price target.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock dropped 13% in its worst one day drop in years after news broke that the SEC was suing CEO Elon Musk.more
CEO Elon Musk was sued by the SEC for an August tweet in which he stated his desire to take the company private. The tweet resulted in an immediate boost in Tesla share prices, all of which have been wiped out in the ensuing weeks. The SEC is challenging Musk’s intentions and capacity to take the company private at the time of the tweet.
Zero Hedge provides analysis:
“To be clear, near-term if Tesla is able to ramp the Model 3 over the coming quarters, we believe cash flow should improve,” Joseph Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said Friday. “Having Elon Musk as CEO has undoubtedly made that easier in the past. Securing attractive funding in the future could be more difficult.”
Tesla holds $11.5 billion in foreign debt, which is mostly held by the European Insurance Company Allianz. New capital will be harder and more expensive for the company to acquire, especially if CEO Elon Musk is forced to step down.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has maintained an extremely high level of production and met its quarterly goal with two days to go.more
Despite a quarter of drama, doubt, and delays, Tesla has broken records in achieving its electric vehicle production goal this quarter. After Thursday’s news of an SEC suit against Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the news of successful quarterly production is a welcome victory for the auto-manufacturer.
Electrek provides context:
Extrapolated for a year, it is equivalent to an annual production rate of 320,000 vehicles. It’s quite significant when you consider that Tesla produced just about 2,000 vehicles back in 2012.
This record performance comes at a strange time for Tesla as Musk is being sued by the SEC, but I personally think that this accomplishment should outweigh the authorities going after Musk because of a few tweets.
Tesla’s flagship Model 3 was facing months of difficulties and delays in production this quarter, but the company has managed to produce 51,000 cars with days of production to go.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed suit against Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and that was the final straw for one Wall Street firm. Citigroup is tapping out on Tesla. more
CNBC shares the firm’s take.
Citigroup downgraded Tesla’s stock to a sell rating from neutral Friday, a day after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a fraud lawsuit against CEO Elon Musk.
The brokerage detailed two paths forward for the electric car maker, one with Musk and one without. And both options aren’t great for stakeholders.
Citi has slashed its price target for Tesla down to $225. The firm provided some insight on the current conundrum for the company in a note to clients.
“There’s little question that Mr. Musk’s departure would likely cause harm to Tesla’s brand, stakeholder confidence and fundraising,” the note read in part. “If Mr. Musk ends up staying on, the reputational harm from this might still prevent the stock from immediately returning to ‘normal.'”

A tweet from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has led to an investigation by the SEC. Back in August, Musk dropped a major piece of previously unannounced news on Twitter. As the SEC has now made crystal clear for him, that’s a no no for publicly traded companies.   more
Investor’s Business Daily has the news on Tesla.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk charging securities fraud and sought to ban him as a director of a public company.
Musk misled investors in August with statements that he could take the company private at $420 a share, SEC officials said in a press conference late Thursday. The agency also alleges statements that funding for the transaction had been secured were also misleading. Musk’s contention that the only remaining uncertainty was a shareholder vote also led investors astray, the SEC said.
“We allege that Musk’s statements were false and misleading because they lacked any basis in fact,” said Stephanie Avakian, the SEC’s co-director of enforcement. The agency notes that it doesn’t appear that Musk had secured financing when he made the announcement, and that any deals he may have been pointing to were ripe with contingencies.
“An officer’s celebrity status or reputation as a technological innovator does not give license to take those responsibilities lightly,” explained Steven Peikin, an SEC co-director of enforcement.
Tesla Inc shares fell $35.37 (-11.50%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -1.23%, versus a 10.35% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The company used its impressive showcase of the tiles to help validate its $2.6 billion acquisition of Solar City. Musk has stated that the lack of widespread success with the tiles is due to lengthy process of confirming the adequacy of a roof to sustain the technology for 30 years.
CNBC gives details on the situation:
“I would expect these solar roofing tiles, in just a few years, to be quite reasonably priced if they can get the market interest that they’re hoping for,” said Dan Kammen, an energy professor at University of California, Berkeley. “It’s not just a roofing shingle anymore, it’s a power plant on your roof.”
Experts anticipate a wave of new solar installations within three to five years.
Tesla says solar roof installations will scale up later this year and into 2019.
Tesla hopes to increase cost-parity in its roof panels by making solar tile installations long-lasting with resilience for thirty-plus years.

2018-09-21,Report: Tesla (TSLA) Cutting it Close on Quarterly Production Totals,1,299.10,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-report-tesla-tsla-cutting-it-close-on-quarterly-production-totals/,"
Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will have to maintain very high production rates to reach its production goals this quarter.more
In addition to maintaining high production rates recently, the Model 3 received perfect safety scores. But Tesla is still facing challenges maintaining its production goals (6,000 vehicles per week) every week and it will be a challenge to reach its low end goal of 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles.
Electrek provides their opinion on the situation:
As usual, let me start by saying that no matter how you look at those numbers, Tesla is producing electric vehicles at an incredible rate, better than any legacy automaker, and that should be celebrated.
The lower-end is still achievable, but Tesla is going to have to maintain the higher production rate that it achieved over several days earlier this month. I still think Tesla can get close to an overall production of 80,000 cars in the quarter, which would be extremely impressive.
CEO Elon Musk said Tesla is on track for its most amazing quarter in history.
Tesla, Inc shares rose $0.70 (+0.23%) in after-hours trading Friday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.93%, versus a 10.35% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) earns positive feedback on its Model 3 after months of controversy.more
After months of volatility at the premier electric car manufacturer, Tesla is enjoying a perfect score for safety on its Model 3 vehicle. All of Tesla’s vehicles have now earned a 5-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, including the Model X sport utility vehicle and the Tesla Model S sedan.
CNBC provides details on the challenges the Model 3 has been facing:
Much has been said about Tesla’s “production hell,” as CEO Elon Musk has called it. The company has missed targets by several months as it worked to ramp up production. At the end of the second quarter Tesla said it was repeatedly producing 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, a goal it originally aimed to achieve at the end of 2017. As production improves, the company faces other challenges. Recently Musk said in response to a customer complaint on Twitter that Tesla is now going through “delivery logistics hell.”
Other reviewing agencies have similarly lauded the Model 3, although its path to success has been fraught with challenges. The model has been criticized for an unfavorable stopping distance, which the Musk-led auto-manufacturer remedied with a software update, and for its autopilot driver assistance system, which has been involved in several crashes.
Tesla, Inc shares were trading at $300.87 per share on Thursday afternoon, up $1.85 (+0.62%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.37%, versus a 10.98% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was criticized by AutoNation leader Mike Jackson for what he calls a “bait-and-switch” strategy, as he predicted Tesla will not be a major player in the electric car industrymore
Jackson believes Elon Musk doesn’t possess a sustainable business strategy, pointing to the frequently publicized production problems with the Model 3. Meanwhile, he perceives established auto-makers as having an edge in the market as they use profits from trucks and other vehicles to subsidize electric car production, while Tesla must use shareholders to subsidize their research and development.
CNBC provides quotes from the AutoNation leader:
“We’re past the inflection point on electrification,” Jackson told CNBC on Wednesday, predicting 30 percent of vehicles will be electric in about 10 years. “I think if Tesla was there it would be quite something.”
“I think when you’re skimming the Model 3 with a bait-and-switch strategy maybe it works” for a while, the outgoing AutoNation CEO said on “Squawk Box.” “But there’s going to be a day of reckoning.”
Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s behavior has been consistently controversial over the past few months, including an August 7th tweet about taking the company that is being investigated by the Department of Justice, and an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast in which he smoked pot. In the past Mr. Jackson has said that he has no personal beef with Musk or Tesla, and would be willing to sell their vehicles at AutoNation locations.
Tesla, Inc shares were trading at $296.92 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $11.96 (+4.20%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.63%, versus a 10.10% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-09-18,Justice Department Turns Up Heat on Tesla CEO Elon Musk,3,294.84,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-justice-department-turns-up-heat-on-ceo/,"
Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is being investigated by the Department of Justice in regards to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk about taking the company private.more
Tesla shares declined by 7.1 percent after news of the investigation came out early Tuesday morning. The Justice Department is running a criminal investigation in conjunction with a civil fraud probe sponsored by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk’s August 7th tweet about taking Tesla private resulted in a major increase in stock prices, which has been lost in the past few weeks after various other controversies involving the flamboyant CEO.
CNBC provides an acknowledgement from Tesla about the situation:
“Last month, following Elon’s announcement that he was considering taking the company private, Tesla received a voluntary request for documents from the DOJ and has been cooperative in responding to it. We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process. We respect the DOJ’s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received.”
The primary issue is a potential violation of the SEC’s rule 14e-8, which prohibits publicly traded companies from announcing plans about buying or selling securities with the intention of manipulating the stock price or inability to follow through on their claims.
Tesla, Inc shares were trading at $284.77 per share on Tuesday afternoon, down $10.07 (-3.42%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -8.54%, versus a 10.07% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has plans to enter the fiercely competitive pick-up truck market.more
Despite recent turmoil in the the electric vehicle manufacturing company, Tesla is seeking entry into one of the most competitive markets in the auto-industry. CEO Elon Musk’s bold vision could pay off in carving a niche, high quality pick-up model, as its electric motor would be able generate the torque and power necessary for towing.
From Market Insider:
CEO Elon Musk seems pretty excited about the pickup, suggesting that it will have range well beyond the 300-plus miles currently delivered by Tesla’s top-of-the-line batteries in its existing cars. He’s also said that it will be able to serve up 240-volt, on-site power to plug in tools, and have towing capacity that’s as good or better than what customers expect from Chevy, Ford, and RAM’s full-size offerings.
The level of competition in the pick-up market is best highlighted by some of the biggest players currently participating in the market. Despite their high quality, Toyota’s Tundra only sold around 115,000 vehicles in the US while Ford’s F-150 model only sold 900,000. As some of the most competitive pick ups in the market, they showcase the challenge Tesla would likely face upon entry.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has yer another batch of problems on its plate. According to CEO Elon Musk, the company has followed up its ongoing production issues with troubles on the delivery front. more
CNBC shares what the Tesla chief had to say.
Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk acknowledged that the electric carmaker’s problems have now shifted to delivery logistics from production delays, the latest speed bump in its efforts to achieve profitability.
“Sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We’re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly,” Musk said in a tweet in response to a customer complaint on delivery delay.
The customer had complained that “my delivery has been delayed indefinite,” and shared a picture of a lot of Tesla vehicles that are apparently ready to be delivered to waiting customers. The electric vehicle maker has been working through a countless number of issues on the production front, and it sounds like another wrench has been thrown into things with delivery troubles.
We’ll have to wait and see if the company solves this latest batch of problems quickly or if it lingers in the press for days on end before updates are made.

Despite a number of controversies that continue to loom large for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), shares of the electric vehicle maker remain quite popular with the younger crowd. Data from one popular stock trading app indicates that Tesla still has plenty of fans in spite of its troubles.  more
Business Insider passes along one positive sign for Tesla.
Despite that, Tesla is still one of the most-popular stocks among millennial investors. On Robinhood, Tesla was the second most-added stock over the past week, with a total of 11,316 investors adding shares, up 13% from last week, according to Business Insider’s tracking of the data.
Tesla is the 14th most popular stock on the brokerage, up from 17th last week.
Executives have been fleeing the automaker, and CEO Elon Musk has raised eyebrows numerous times with comments on social media and curious behavior during interviews.  That’s led to a volatile roller coaster ride for investors, but it seems to be inspiring traders on Robinhood.
Over the past week, more than 11,000 investors scooped up shares on Robinhood, a no-fee brokerage that has proven to be quite a hit with the younger crowd.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are falling and the company has lost 13 key executives over the last year. Elon Musk’s volatile behavior is in large part to blame, according to CNBC’s Gene Munster, who argues that the company must restructure its board.more
After a summer of incendiary tweets and most recently a controversial episode on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Elon Musk is being criticized by many analysts for hurting his company’s success. Musk is an integral part of Tesla and pulling him from the company is not the answer, but the famous CEO’s board is failing to protect him from his own worst impulses.
CNBC‘s Gene Munster offers a potential solution:
If Musk were to step down and another director gave up his or her seat, the company could explore bringing on a new chairperson with no ties to Musk that may be able to influence him. Al Gore, currently on Apple’s board, could be an interesting fit given his interest in climate change. Former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney would also be a good option as the former chairman at the company.
Munster adds his belief in Musk as the spirit of innovation driving the company and that those calling for his firing are misguided. He reasserts that the issue is that no one on the board is strong enough to stand up to him, and that restructuring the company’s decision-making apparatus is the best way to rebound the ailing company.

Shareholders of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) seem to be on a never-ending roller coaster ride, and one analyst is about ready to get off. Instead, the analyst is looking towards a legacy automaker as an appealing alternative. more
Marketwatch‘s Jeff Reeves shares his insight on Tesla.
I understand Tesla’s growth potential has many investors hanging on, particularly if they bought years ago and are playing with house money at this point.
But it seems quite dangerous to rely on blind faith. In fact, boring General Motors GM, +1.05% may be a better bet over the next 12 to 18 months.
Reeves points to various controversies that have been swirling around Tesla in recent months, including CEO Elon Musk’s latest bizarre interview. Controversy aside, he’s also getting a little tired of Tesla’s failure to deliver on promises.
He points to GM as an interesting alternative instead, and noted that the automaker’s current valuation metrics look awfully appealing.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has been acting pretty strangely as of late, and one prominent Wall Street pundit believes he should take a break from his duties.more
As CNBC reports, Cramer is calling for Musk to take some time off:
Elon Musk’s “self-destructive” behavior is a major concern for Tesla shareholders, and perhaps the board should put the CEO on a short medical leave, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Tuesday.
“I’m worried about the guy,” Cramer said on “Squawk on the Street.” “Medical leave is fine. I think the board puts him on medical leave. That’s not a sin. It could be a good thing.”
It’s not all bad news, however. Cramer said that “a healthy Elon Musk is something that can take the stock higher.”
Musk’s seemingly strange behavior began several months ago, when he angrily cut short an earnings call with analysts. Since then, he’s tweeted about taking the company public, had an eye-opening New York Times interview, and appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast apparently drinking whiskey and smoking marijuana.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $277.28 per share on Tuesday afternoon, down $8.22 (-2.88%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -10.94%, versus a 9.34% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have had a rough several weeks, but not everyone on Wall Street is swinging bearish on the electric automaker.more
As CNBC reports, at least one prominent bull still believes in the stock:
Investors should still buy Tesla’s stock in spite of all the “drama” surrounding the electric car maker and its management, an analyst at Baird said after touring the company’s factory.
“We recently toured the Fremont factory and came away incrementally positive” about the company, analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a Monday note titled “Tesla, Inc.: Buy Even with Drama in LBC.” “Gigafactory 1 creates a significant barrier for competition and manufacturing capability should be a competitive advantage for TSLA over the long term. We believe TSLA’s Gigafactory enables the company to drive down costs through an industrialization of battery pack assembly and economies of scale.”
Accordingly, Kallo reiterated his Buy rating and $411 price target on TSLA, which suggests a 56% upside from current levels. Tesla Inc shares were trading at $285.34 per share on Monday afternoon, up $22.10 (+8.40%).

2018-09-10,Short-Seller Predicts Single-Digit Stock Price for Tesla Inc (TSLA),3,263.24,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-short-seller-predicts-single-digit-stock-price-for-tesla-inc-tsla/,"
The bottom is really going to fall out for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), according to short seller Robert Chapman. During an appearance on CNBC, he explained how far he thinks share prices are going to fall. more
CNBC passes along Chapman’s take on Tesla.
Tesla shares are extremely overvalued and will drop precipitously, Robert Chapman said Friday.
Chapman downplayed concerns over CEO Elon Musk’s erratic behavior, instead focusing on the carmaker’s financials for his bearish view.
Chapman, who is short shares of Tesla, shared his take during an appearance on the network’s ‘Halftime Report.’ “I actually don’t think you should short it on [Musk’s] judgment. I think he is a fascinating businessman, probably the most incredible entrepreneur since Edison …. Selling him short, I think, is a mistake,” he said. “I think selling short a $50 billion enterprise auto manufacturer that is struggling to create a business model that is sustainably profitable — that, I think, is a great trade.”
As he sees it, “inevitably you have a stock that’s headed into the single digits.”
Tesla Inc shares rose $9.10 (+3.46%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -12.64%, versus a 9.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is on a push to hit its Q3 Model 3 goals, and that has led the automaker to offer up an additional perk to reservation holders. A limited number of the sought after vehicles are being made available for immediate delivery. more
Techspot has the news on Tesla.
Tesla wants to increase its Model 3 sales figures before the end of the third quarter, and that means getting the vehicles to customers as quickly as possible. To achieve this, the company has started “immediate deliveries” of the EVs on a “first come, first served” basis.
The news comes from website Electrek, which writes that Tesla is emailing day-one reservation holders to inform them that a limited number of Model 3 rear-wheel-drive cars are available for immediate delivery.
The offer is effective as of today. “As a first-day reservation holder, you’re invited to take advantage of this opportunity on a first-come, first-served basis,” the email from Tesla reads in part.
There is no word on exactly how many Model 3’s will be made available for the offer. Tesla continues to push towards its goal of producing 50,000 – 55,000 Model 3’s in Q3.
Tesla Inc shares rose $6.26 (+2.38%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -15.45%, versus a 8.69% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-09-08,Cramer: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Bonds More Telling Than Its Stock Price,4,263.24,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-cramer-tesla-inc-tsla-bonds-more-telling-than-its-stock/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) relies heavily on recent bond issues to fund its operations, but the value of those bonds is plummeting.more
As CNBC notes, venerable market pundit Jim Cramer sees this as a major danger sign:
“It’s the bondholders who matter, not the stockholders, and the bonds keep going down,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on “Squawk on the Street.”
Tesla’s 2025 bonds dropped on Friday to an all-time low of 82.03 cents on the dollar, down from 93 cents on the dollar on Aug. 7 — the day Musk announced he had secured funding to take Tesla private. The drop raised the bond’s yield to 8.89 percent. (Bond prices move inversely to yields.)
“I don’t even look at the stock anymore, because that’s emotional. I look at the 2025 bonds, and I look at it incessantly,” Cramer concluded.
Tesla’s chief accounting officer just resigned after only a month on the job, citing “the level of public attention placed on the company,” the company said in an 8K filing. That’s another “red flag,” according to Cramer.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $263.24 on Friday, down $17.71 (-6.30%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -15.45%, versus a 8.69% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is on the hunt for a new chief accounting officer. That’s because the man that previously held the position is resigning just one month after coming on board. more
CNBC has the details on the latest troubling sing for Tesla.
Tesla’s chief accounting officer, Dave Morton, has resigned after just a month, citing “the level of public attention placed on the company,” the carmaker said in an 8K filing.
News of Morton’s quick departure follows CEO Elon Musk’s bizarre weed-and-whiskey interview with Joe Rogan.
Morton provided additional insight on his decision in the filing. “Since I joined Tesla on August 6, the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations,” he said. “As a result, this caused me to reconsider my future. I want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla’s leadership or its financial reporting.”
Prior to joining Tesla, Morton had spent more than two decades with Seagate Technology, most recently as CFO.
Tesla Inc shares fell $21.71 (-7.73%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -14.57%, versus a 8.47% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk just can’t seem to keep himself out of the headlines. Musk has created quite a buzz in the wake of his appearance on a live internet show. People are certainly talking, but not all of the feedback has been positive.   more
CNBC has the scoop on Musk’s appearance.
Billionaire Elon Musk took viewers by surprise late Thursday when he briefly smoked marijuana and drank whiskey during a live interview.
The Tesla chief executive was speaking with comedian Joe Rogan, an advocate of legalizing weed, on his live internet show when he was handed the joint. A spokesperson for Tesla was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.
“The Joe Rogan Experience” is quite popular, and Musk’s appearance quickly went viral. The pair was engaged in a back and forth on a number of topics when Musk was handed a marijuana cigarette.
“Yeah, I think I tried one once,” Musk said.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) swung and missed on weekly Model 3 production goals, but it appears that the automaker remains on track for the quarter as a whole. more
Elektrek has the scoop on where things stand for Tesla on the Model 3 production front.
Tesla has been aiming for a production rate of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of August and an overall production of 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3 vehicles throughout the third quarter.
Electrek has learned that the automaker missed the 6,000 unit production rate goal, but Tesla is nonetheless on track for its overall third quarter goal.
It follows our report from last week about Tesla being on track for a production record this quarter but slightly behind its ambitious Model 3 goal.
Sources tell Elektrek that Tesla has produced over 34,700 Model 3’s thus far in Q3. That places the electric vehicle on pace to reach its quarterly goal by the end of the month.
As always with Tesla, there are no guarantees that another wrench won’t be thrown into production, so we’ll wait for the final tally as opposed to assuming it’s a sure thing.

Goldman Sachs has resumed its coverage of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Unfortunately for the electric vehicle maker, the investment giant doesn’t envision things going along swimmingly in the near term. more
CNBC shares Goldman’s take on Tesla.
Tesla’s electric car sales will suffer due to increased competition from other luxury automakers, according to Goldman Sachs.
The firm resumed coverage of Tesla with a sell rating, predicting the competition will cut into the company’s share of the electric car market.
Analyst David Tamberrino has placed a six-month price target of $210 on Tesla. He outlined the firm’s concerns on the automaker in a note to clients.
“We see the medium-to-longer term industry backdrop as challenging for Tesla’s products; this follows from an increasing number of EV launches from both traditional OEMs and other start-up competitors — at a time when the company’s product cadence hits a gap,” he wrote. “We believe the company will see pressure to its lead in EVs as competition catches up.”

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk may have a new battle on his hands over the potential direction of his company.more
As Reuters reports, the largest asset manager in the world voted to install a new chairman for the company:
Funds run by BlackRock Inc voted in favor of a recent shareholder proposal that would have required Tesla Inc to replace Elon Musk with an independent chairman.
BlackRock-managed funds voted for a measure requiring the chairman be an independent director, according to BlackRock’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The proposal, which was defeated, would not have affected Musk’s standing as Tesla’s chief executive officer.
The proposal was roundly rejected by a vote of approximately 86 million to 17 million, but it’s important to note that such a measure would have been pretty much unthinkable just six months ago. In that period, Tesla has endured production issues, an SEC investigation over a failed bid to take the company private, and concerns over Musk’s physical and mental health.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $301.66 on Friday, down $1.49 (-0.49%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.11%, versus a 9.71% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is dealing with yet another public relations fiasco. As the company works towards mending another self-inflicted wound, questions abound as to whether or not its credibility will be able to be repaired this time around. more
CNBC takes a look at the situation at hand for Tesla.
Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s credibility will suffer from CEO Elon Musk giving up on his plan to take the carmaker private.
Late Friday, Musk said in a blog post the company will remain publicly traded, citing resistance from existing shareholders to his plan to take it private.
That follows weeks of drama that stemmed from Musk’s flippant remarks on Twitter about taking the company private. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak is among those who believes the company’s standing with investors has been damaged as a result of the latest episode.
“We think credibility has taken a hit. [The blog post] reinforces the idea that this whole episode was not planned or fully thought out and thus could get added to the list of debatable statements from the company over the years,” he wrote in a note to clients. “It has become clear to us that funding was not secured or there was not sufficient interest to take the company private at $420/share.”
Tesla Inc shares fell $0.77 (-0.24%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 2.01%, versus a 9.69% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

A new report from Elektrek notes that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has made impressive progress on the production front for its Model 3 vehicles, but the company remains behind its own goals. The company still hasn’t been able to reach its desired output of 5,000 Model 3’s per week.  more
Electrek has the scoop on Tesla.
Virtually every new quarter for Tesla comes with new records and critical financial milestones. This quarter is no exception as Tesla attempts to become profitable and increase Model 3 production in a big way.
Electrek has learned that Tesla is on track for an incredible production record this quarter, but at the same time, the company is behind on its Model 3 production goal. It is also a different tally than other “guesstimations” out there.
Electrek pegs the company’s weekly run rate for Model 3’s in the range of 3,500 to 4,900 vehicles. At current rates, the outlet estimates that Tesla will wrap up the quarter with 70,000 vehicles produced.
That would break the previous quarter’s record-setting mark of 53,000, but it remains behind where the company wanted to be at this point.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $319.27 per share on Monday afternoon, down $3.55 (-1.10%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 2.54%, versus a 9.51% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

It’s shaping up to be another wild day for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders. CEO Elon Musk has announced that he’s no longer thinking about taking the company private, and the market is poised to react accordingly.  more
CNBC has the news on Tesla.
Trading in Tesla shares in Germany on Monday pointed to a 5 percent drop when U.S. markets open as investors reacted to Chief Executive Elon Musk’s decision to abandon plans to take the luxury electric car maker private.
Musk said in a blog post late on Friday that consultations done with the help of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had shown most of Tesla’s existing shareholders opposed the deal he proposed on Twitter three weeks ago to widespread shock on Wall Street.
Earlier this month, Musk rattled the market by flippantly remarking that he was seriously considering taking the company private in a post on Twitter. Tesla investors have been on a roller coaster ride ever since, and it looks like there’s more volatility to come until the market puts this latest tidbit on the automaker behind it.
We’ll have to wait and see if Musk lessens his engagement on social media after this latest batch of Tweet-inspired drama.
Tesla Inc shares fell $10.99 (-3.40%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 3.68%, versus a 8.66% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shocked the investing world a couple weeks back when CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to announce he was strongly considering taking his company private.more
The infamous “Funding secured” tweet set off a firestorm of controversy, including lawsuits and an SEC investigation.
Well, it appears it was all for naught. After a board meeting on Tuesday last week, the company decided to stay a public company. As the BBC News reports, however, the fallout is far from over:
Earlier this month, Elon Musk shocked investors by announcing on Twitter that he had funding secured to take Tesla private at a value of $72bn (£57bn).
It later transpired that he had not closed a deal with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, with unhappy investors launching a lawsuit against him after the news.
The lawsuits are still continuing against Mr Musk despite his cancellation of the privatisation plan, as is an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to see if the tweet broke securities laws.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $322.82 on Friday, up $2.72 (+0.85%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 3.68%, versus a 8.66% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Will Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) actually go private? That question is still looming in the air, which only adds to the usual volatility that surrounds the automaker. We can add many traders from one group of market watchers to the category of those who are doubtful about a deal.  more
Reuters has the news on Tesla.
Investors in the debt and in the equity options of electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O) are betting the take-private deal described by Chief Executive Elon Musk will not materialize.
Like its stock price, Tesla bonds have given up all of the gains they made after Musk shocked investors with a tweet on Aug. 7, saying he had “funding secured” for a possible buyout deal at $420 per share.
Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management, provided some perspective he has been able to glean from the bond markets. “If these bonds were priced for a takeover, they would trade at a serious premium to the conversion value compared to when the deal was announced,” he said. “The convertibles are certainly not trading as if this company is going to be taken private at $420 and they never did.”
As is always the case with Tesla, we’ll have to patiently wait and see what transpires while keeping an eye on Twitter for unexpected updates.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $321.05 per share on Friday morning, up $0.95 (+0.30%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 3.12%, versus a 8.36% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-08-23,Analyst: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model 3 Severely Underpriced,3,321.64,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-analyst-tesla-inc-tsla-model-3-severely-underpriced/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is going to run into problems over the way it has priced its Model 3 sedan. That’s the take from UBS, which has reiterated its claim that the automaker is going to lose money on the vehicle. more
CNBC shares the firm’s critique of Tesla’s strategy.
Buyers waiting for that long-promised $35,000 Tesla Model 3 sedan probably shouldn’t hold their breath.
After UBS recently pulled apart a Model 3 and compared its quality and estimated costs with two competitors, UBS analyst Colin Langan said he thinks Tesla will never be able to make money at the $35,000 the company originally planned to charge for an entry-level model designed for the masses.
During an appearance on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch,’ Langan explained what the problem is as the firm sees it. “This car needs to sell in the low $40,000’s to break even, and I think they’re a long way from the 25 percent growth margin target, unless they can sell it well over $50,000,” he explained.
No comment has been forthcoming from Tesla as of yet.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $323.83 per share on Thursday morning, up $2.19 (+0.68%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 4.01%, versus a 8.39% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk raised some eyebrows with several revelations made during an interview with the New York Times, including the fact that his hectic work schedule is beginning to take a toll on him. While numerous of observers have opined that he should seriously consider cutting back if it’s getting to be too much, Musk doesn’t see that as a viable option at the present time.   more
CNBC has some additional insight on the Tesla chief’s current plight.
Arianna Huffington is calling on Elon Musk to adopt a healthier work-life balance, but the Tesla CEO says that’s not an option.
In a tweet early Sunday after arriving home from a late night at a Tesla factory, Musk told the Huffington Post founder that his electric car company and Ford are the only two American automakers that have avoided bankruptcy.
Huffington shared an open letter calling for Musk to take some time to “refuel and recharge.” In response, Musk shared the situation as he see it. “You think this is an option. It is not,” he wrote.
While Musk sees burning the candle at both ends as the only option at the moment, considering Huffington’s suggestions and working towards a goal of scaling back gradually wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world. “Working 120-hour weeks doesn’t leverage your unique qualities, it wastes them,” she added. “You can’t simply power through — that’s just not how our bodies and our brains work.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $320.03 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $11.59 (+3.76%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 2.79%, versus a 8.32% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-08-20,Analyst: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Waiting Too Long to Raise Capital,3,308.44,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-analyst-tesla-inc-tsla-waiting-too-long-to-raise-capital/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and company would be wise to figure out what the overall game plan is in terms of the company’s financial path ahead. That’s the gist of Citi Research’s recent take on the electric vehicle maker that’s considering taking itself private.  more
CNBC shares the firm’s take on Tesla.
Tesla’s finances may be hurt by the negative ramifications of CEO Elon Musk’s controversial plan to take the company private, according to Citi Research.
The firm reiterated its “neutral/high risk” rating on Tesla shares, citing the company’s deteriorating balance sheet.
Analyst Itay Michaeli is sticking to his $356 price target for Tesla for the time being, but it’s safe to say he would feel a lot better if there was a clear direction from the company. “Ultimately, credit risk is a function of confidence, without which a company’s financial position can quickly spiral into distress. Though we don’t think Tesla has necessarily entered such a spiral, the current state of affairs heightens the focus,” he said. “If a go-private transaction is looking less likely, we think it’d be wise for Tesla to at least try to raise significant new equity capital sooner rather than later.”
Shareholders of Tesla have been on a roller coaster ride for some time now, and we can safely assume that something resembling clarity would be a welcome development for them as well.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $308.44 per share on Monday afternoon, up $2.94 (+0.96%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.93%, versus a 7.96% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The sentiment surrounding Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has shifted once again. The bears are back in force, and we can add one major name to the list of those who believe the automaker is poised for a downward turn.  more
CNBC has the news on Tesla.
Tesla shares will fall dramatically the rest of this year because CEO Elon Musk’s plan to go private is becoming more tenuous, J.P. Morgan said Monday.
After the note, Tesla shares are down 3.6 percent Monday.
The firm has slashed its price target for shares of Tesla from $308 all the way down to $195. Analyst Ryan Brinkman has reiterated his underwight rating for Tesla, and he threw some shade on chatter about the company going private while doing so.
“Our interpretation of subsequent events leads us to believe that funding was not secured for a going private transaction, nor was there any formal proposal,” he wrote.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly in talks with a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund about potentially taking the company private, but a new report has emerged that the latter isn’t going to be sitting on its hands in the interim. The same fund is also looking to invest in one of Tesla’s key rivals.   more
CNBC has the scoop on Tesla’s competition.
PIF, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund that Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk has said could help him fund an offer to take his electric car maker private, is in talks to invest in aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The talks between privately-held Lucid Motors and PIF underscore the latter’s appetite to invest in electric car makers to diversify the oil-rich Middle Eastern kingdom’s investment portfolio.
The report indicates that PIF’s initial investment in Lucid could be for as much as $500 million, but there could be additional investments to come if the vehicle maker reaches certain milestones. Sources note that there’s no guarantee a deal will be reached.
As for Tesla, CEO Elon Musk shook up the markets when he casually shared his thoughts on taking the company private on Twitter, but there’s also no guarantee a deal will be reached between the two sides.
Tesla Inc shares fell $9.78 (-3.20%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -1.88%, versus a 7.73% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

If you haven’t heard by now, the fate of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rests on its ability to produce its electric cars at a much higher scale.more
The automaker has fallen under fire for constantly missing self-imposed production deadlines, but there appears to be a light at the end of the tunnel. As CNBC notes, one analyst recently toured Tesla’s factory, and came away with a bullish conclusion:
“Tesla seems well on the way to achieving a steady weekly production rate of 5,000 to 6,000 units per week,” Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers said in a note following an inside tour of the company’s facilities.
“We are incrementally positive on Tesla following our visit. We have confidence in their production. We did not see anything to suggest that Model 3 cannot reach 6,000 units per week, and 7,000 to 8,000 with very little incremental capital expenditure.”
Despite the upbeat note, Tesla shares took a heavy dive late last week following a blockbuster New York Times interview with CEO Elon Musk. The executive admitted that the last year has been the most stressful of his life, and even raised concerns about his physical and mental health.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $305.50 on Friday, down $29.95 (-8.93%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -1.88%, versus a 7.73% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a company in flux.more
The electric automaker continues to struggle to boost production of its in-demand Model 3 sedan, faces major cash flow issues, and its stock is under constant pressure from a barrage of short sellers.
In a recent New York Times interview, CEO Elon Musk opened up about just how difficult the past year has been:
In an hourlong interview with The New York Times, he choked up multiple times, noting that he nearly missed his brother’s wedding this summer and spent his birthday holed up in Tesla’s offices as the company raced to meet elusive production targets on a crucial new model.
Asked if the exhaustion was taking a toll on his physical health, Mr. Musk answered: “It’s not been great, actually. I’ve had friends come by who are really concerned.”
Meanwhile, Musk — ever the bombastic showman — tweeted last week that he want to take his company private, and supposedly has massive Saudi-led financial backing to do so. This prompted an SEC investigation, and likely even more stress for Musk.
Tesla reportedly has been looking for a true second-in-command behind Musk for years, with no success. That search is no doubt reaching a crescendo these days, as the executive’s judgement and health fall under question.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $305.50 on Friday, down $29.95 (-8.93%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -1.88%, versus a 7.73% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

If Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) actually does wind up going private, shareholders could find themselves with an unexpected situation to deal with. CEO Elon Musk wants to give existing shareholders a chance to remain invested, and that could lead to a tax bill.  more
CNBC has the details on the situation at hand for Tesla shareholders.
There’s another reason Tesla’s faithful investors might want to scrutinize CEO Elon Musk’s public musings on taking the company private: Shareholders would likely face a tax bill.
Musk’s surprise announcement last week — which is under review for possible violations of securities laws, according to various published reports — included his hope to let shareholders remain invested in a special fund if the company were to go private. He also said he would offer $420 per share.
Bill Smith, managing director at CBIZ MHM’s National Tax Office in Washington, explained how Musk’s plan would work for shareholders. “It would be like buying a mutual fund, only the fund only invests in one stock,” Smith explained.
To make that happen, shareholders would be selling their shares of Tesla to purchase shares in the fund. That’s a taxable event, and both long and short-term shareholders would be on the hook for taxes on profits.
Tesla Inc shares fell $8.07 (-2.41%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 7.74%, versus a 7.35% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Yet another situation involving Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is playing out on Twitter. A former employee has been tweeting out various details about alleged problems with Tesla vehicles and parts.more
CNBC has the news on the Tesla whistleblower.
A former Tesla process technician, Martin Tripp, is tweeting internal emails, photos and vehicle identification numbers that he says are evidence of flawed manufacturing practices at Tesla’s battery factory, and of product sold by Tesla that is imperfect, and could put drivers’ lives at risk.
Tesla has characterized Tripp as a disgruntled ex-employee and saboteur in the past.
Tripp has previously spoken out about problems at Tesla’s Gigafactory, and he claims that CEO Elon Musk knew all about it. Musk has denied those claims, and a company spokesperson has once again refuted what Tripp’s allegations.
“As we’ve said before, these claims are false and Mr. Tripp does not even have personal knowledge about the safety claims that he is making,” the spokesperson said. “No punctured cells have ever been used in any Model 3 vehicles in any way, and all VINs that have been identified have safe batteries. Notably, there have been zero battery safety issues in any Model 3.”

A Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rival from across the Pacific is prepared to throw its hat into the ring of the US stock market. Chinese startup Nio has filed for a a $1.8 billion initial public offering. more
Investor’s Business Daily has the news on the Tesla rival.
Chinese electric-car startup Nio aims to become the first Chinese automaker to have a U.S. initial public offering, after filing for a $1.8 billion IPO.
The IPO will help the luxury-car maker compete with Tesla (TSLA). Ironically, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is exploring taking his company private.
Nio launched its first vehicle back in December, a fully electric SUV that checks in at a lower price point than the Tesla Model X sport utility. The Shanghai-based firm intends to have an autonomous electric vehicle for the American market by 2020.
Backers of the startup include Chinese internet giants Baidu and Tencent.

Musk casually tweeted the news last week, and the markets were unexpectedly jolted. It got to the point that trading in shares of Tesla had to be halted due to the gyrations Musk’s commentary inspired. Reporters, analysts, observers, and shareholders have been scrambling ever since in a bid to make sense of it all.
A subpoena is generally the first step towards a formal inquiry. No response from Musk has emerged on social media as of yet.
Tesla Inc shares fell $0.76 (-0.22%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 8.78%, versus a 6.49% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of B (Buy), and is ranked #4 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.

2018-08-15,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Board Looking to Rein in CEO Elon Musk’s Approach to Social Media,3,347.64,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-board-looking-to-rein-in-ceo-elon/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has long had a proclivity for taking to Twitter to share what’s on his mind, and that has led to a number of awkward instances through the years. He took things in a new direction last week with posts about sensitive company information, and Tesla’s board appears to have finally perked up and taken notice.  more
CNBC shares the scuttlebutt surrounding Tesla’s board.
Elon Musk, the electric-car maker’s co-founder and chief executive, stirred up a public storm by announcing on Twitter last week that he wanted to turn Tesla into a private company. In recent days, according to people familiar with the matter, some of his fellow board members delivered a stern message: Stop tweeting.
Mr. Musk hasn’t heeded that advice. He has continued to post messages on Twitter, publicly plotting the company’s strategy and in some cases making assertions of dubious accuracy. That has only added to the chaos engulfing the struggling company.
According to a report from the New York Times, Tesla’s outside directors have hired a pair of powerful legal firms to represent them. One is tasked with navigating potential fallout with the Securities and Exchange Commission over Musk’s tweets, while another will advise them on proposals from Musk about taking the company private.
It’s unclear if Musk intends to ease up on his Twitter habit in the wake of the latest spectacle he created.
Tesla Inc shares fell $3.40 (-0.98%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 10.68%, versus a 6.65% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-08-14,Cramer: Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO Tweet Will Not Receive SEC Disciplinary Action,3,356.41,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-cramer-tesla-inc-tsla-ceo-tweet-will-not-receive-sec/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will likely walk away from his latest Twitter controversy unscathed. That’s the take from CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who doesn’t believe Musk will be penalized for his tweet about taking the company private.  more
CNBC passes along what Cramer had to say about Tesla.
CNBC’s Jim Cramer warns Tesla critics about getting their hopes up that the federal government will penalize Elon Musk for his tweet about taking the electric auto maker private.
“If you’re waiting for the [Securities and Exchange Commission] to hammer Tesla, well let me just tell you, we’ll be on Mars” by then, Cramer said Tuesday on “Squawk on the Street.”
Last week, Musk raised eyebrows by sharing in a tweet that he was looking to take the company private at a certain price, and he also hinted that he had secured funding. While it’s an unconventional approach to delivering a major piece of news that raised a ton of eyebrows, Cramer notes that it’s par for the course when it comes to Musk.
“We keep expecting a certain level of convention, and [Musk’s] not going to give it to you,” Cramer said. “Therefore, you should stop looking for it.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $352.62 per share on Tuesday morning, down $3.79 (-1.06%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 13.26%, versus a 6.98% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may in fact become a privater company before too long. Just a week after roiling the markets on social media, CEO Elon Musk headed back to Twitter to provide an update on where things stand. more
CNBC passes along what the Tesla chief had to say.
Elon Musk said Monday that he is working with Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake on taking Tesla private.
In a Twitter post, Musk said those two firms are acting as financial advisors, and he’s also working with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Munger, Tolles & Olson as legal advisors.
Musk provided additional insight into what’s going on in a blog post on Monday. “I continue to have discussions with the Saudi fund, and I also am having discussions with a number of other investors. … It is appropriate to complete those discussions before presenting a detailed proposal to an independent board committee,” Musk wrote.
The Tesla honcho has received a ton of criticism for last week’s tweet on potentially taking the company private, and questions are still circulating about whether or not he violated any regulations while doing so.
Tesla Inc shares fell $0.01 (0.00%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 14.47%, versus a 6.61% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-08-11,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Media Buzz Could Vanish If It Goes Private,3,355.49,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-media-buzz-could-vanish-if-it-goes/,"
As a money-losing company, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long relied on shareholders and bondholders to buy into its future growth potential to fund its operations.more
That means the company needs lots of media buzz to keep interest flowing. So for, CEO Elon Musk has done an incredible job of that, but now he’s talking about taking the company private.
Without the daily share price fluctuations — not to mention earnings reports, analyst notes, and the like — how will that affect media buzz? Cullen Roche over at MarketWatch has some interesting thoughts on the matter:
Tesla has a $0 marketing budget. It relies entirely on word of mouth and organic news to generate buzz about the business. This is really interesting in the scope of the stock market because nothing generates buzz quite like Tesla’s stock and the way Musk talks about the stock. You could make a strong argument that Tesla’s most valuable asset is actually its public stock price because it is a near daily source of media attention.
Whether Tesla goes private or not is still up for debate. However, it does seem like a significant amount of attention will be lost if the company does go that route, and that would mean giving up a huge part of what brought the company here in the first place: hype.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $355.49 on Friday, up $3.04 (+0.86%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 14.18%, versus a 7.01% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

If Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is in fact going to go private, then CEO Elon Musk may have to sit on the sidelines while a deal is hammered out. That’s the latest scuttlebutt in a week of never-ending drama surrounding the electric vehicle maker. more
CNBC has the latest on Tesla.
The Tesla board of directors plans to meet with financial advisors next week to formalize a process to explore Elon Musk’s take-private proposal, according to people familiar with the matter.
Musk announced via Twitter this week that he hopes to take the automaker private, in what would be one of the biggest such deals in history.
Musk’s tweet about potentially taking Tesla private disrupted the markets on Tuesday, and trading in shares of the company were temporarily halted. Shares have been gyrating ever since, and there remain questions on whether or not Musk broke any laws by broadcasting a major piece of company news on Twitter.
The Tesla honcho has reportedly talked with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund about funding a potential deal.

On last week’s earnings call, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk shared some insight on the company’s upcoming artificial intelligence processor. We now have an indication on when it will be released, courtesy of a tweet from Musk.   more
CNBC has the news on Tesla’s new processor.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the next generation of hardware for autonomous driving will probably be available by early next year.
On last week’s earnings call, Musk touted the strengths of the coming Autopilot hardware, which will include an artificial intelligence processor developed by Tesla. But he didn’t say when the technology, which the company started working on about three years ago, would be available to car owners.
Musk provided the update in the form of an answer to a question posed on Twitter about when it would be released. “Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot,” he wrote.
There’s no word on how the new hardware upgrades will be implemented as of yet.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk may have to pencil in a meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the near future. Musk’s tweet about potentially taking the company private opened up a bunch of questions, including whether or not he violated any laws on the books.   more
CNBC has the news on Tesla.
Elon Musk’s lawyers are probably pouring over rule 14e-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 right about now.
That regulation is the one the Tesla CEO may or may not have violated when he sent the markets into a frenzy and halted trading in Tesla’s shares after nonchalantly tweeting Tuesday that he was thinking about taking the electric car company private and had “funding secured,” securities lawyers say.
A number of former SEC enforcement lawyers have speculated that the agency has already opened up a probe on the matter. “I can’t imagine that the enforcement division hasn’t opened a file, that they are not calling his counsel or him and saying ‘we would like whatever papers you have about this, if you have written anything down, if you have talked to lenders, if you have materials about that we would like to see them,'” explained attorney Tom Gorman.
The aforementioned rule prohibits public announcements that are intended “to manipulate the market price of the stock of the bidder or subject company,” among other things.

2018-08-08,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Runs Into Solar Production Issues,3,370.34,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-runs-into-solar-production-issues/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) keeps running onto production issues, and we’re not just talking about with its vehicles either. There are problems afoot at its solar production facility as well, and that’s led to some delays. more
Reuters has the details on the problems Tesla is facing with solar production.
Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) production of solar roof tiles has been delayed by assembly-line problems at its new publicly subsidized factory and difficulties producing a product that satisfies the aesthetic demands of CEO Elon Musk, eight former and current employees of both companies told Reuters.
Repeated hold-ups since the Buffalo, New York plant opened last year have forced Tesla’s partner in the joint venture, Panasonic (6752.T), to seek other buyers for the components it had built to sell to Tesla, according to a Panasonic employee, a former Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. The issues have also rattled the faith of state officials in Tesla’s ability to deliver on investment and employment promises it made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies.
Tesla has not offered up any specifics on the troubles it has faced at the Buffalo facility, but the company notes that tweaks are certainly needed before production is ramped up. “We are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process,” the company explained to Reuters. “We plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018.”
We’ll have to wait and see how that turns out, but the report from Reuters casts even more shade in the direction of Tesla’s often-criticized solar wing.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $370.34 per share on Wednesday afternoon, down $9.23 (-2.43%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 18.95%, versus a 7.88% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

All seemed well on the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) front in the wake of last week’s positive earnings report, but that was just the calm before the storm. CEO Elon Musk hopped on the Twitter machine yesterday to hint that the company was going private, and the market is still trying to make sense of it.  more
Marketwatch shares some insight on the situation surrounding Tesla.
A statement from Tesla’s board members on Wednesday raises further questions following the shock tweet from Elon Musk that he wants to take the auto maker private.
The brief news release from Tesla board members—Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice, and James Murdoch—consisted of three sentences:
“Last week, Elon opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private. This included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla’s long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur. The board has met several times over the last week and is taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this,” the brief release said.
So what does that mean for the future of Tesla as a publicly-traded company? That remains unclear, and the head-scratching and brow furrowing is continuing on the street as a result.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $372.06 per share on Wednesday afternoon, down $7.51 (-1.98%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 19.50%, versus a 8.02% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Like you may have been doing, I was monitoring the markets and minding my own business yesterday when suddenly Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk decided to launch a nuclear strike against short-sellers in the form of a tweet. On Twitter, Musk stated he is considering taking the company private at $420 and that he has secured the funding. Just like that, Tesla shares took off. Now I have no skin in the game as to being long or short Tesla, but my concern is about what the standard has become for basically “anything goes” when it comes to what gets said on social media. The SEC has been rather quiet to all the things we have seen in the past. Perhaps a symptom of the complacency of the markets and its participants, but my guess is we will see some major fraudulent activity that begins to impact investors, albeit in the form of insider information, pump and dump, or what have you. I’m not saying Tesla’s CEO is doing something illegal, but when some not so honorable folks see how much stock prices can be manipulated through social media, it will be a free-for-all of bad news/info for shady characters.more

Better Know How to Handle Your Bullpen
Being a New York sports fan (Mets when we’re talking baseball – yes I accept all condolences), I like to listen to the sports radio action online whenever I get a chance. Listening to Mike Francesa (who has made a triumphant return to WFAN after a multi-month quasi-retirement) is always a lot of fun and I enjoy the Yankee phone callers’ drama as much as listening to fellow Mets’ fans moan everyday. One thing that is being brought up is how new Yankees’ manager Aaron Boone has to do a better job with his bullpen or the team could struggle down the stretch. Mike Francesa often likes to point out how good a job the previous manager, Joe Girardi, did with the pen. Girardi spent 10 seasons as manager of the Yankees, leading the team to a 910-710 record and a World Series title. Joe wasn’t always known as the biggest players’ coach and that is what likely made the organization move on, but he was great with his bullpen. If you run a business or manage people, you know there are plenty of levers to pull to get the best out of each and every person in your organization. You don’t want to see them burn out prior to the biggest moments a company could face (new product rollout, market expansions, etc.). The key to long-term success is to know what each person can give you and how far you can take that person with the talent they possess. Just like a baseball manager who has to be able to assess his pitchers and where they are in terms of gas left in the tank, as well as what spots some thrive in better than others. Life is like sports in many ways, even if it’s without those big paychecks in most cases!

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk was back at his favorite past time again today, but at least this time his words of wisdom had a positive impact on the company’s share price. Shares of Tesla spike when Musk dropped a flippant remark about taking the company private. more
Marketwatch has the details on what the Tesla chief had to say.
Tesla Inc. shares jumped as much as 8% midday Tuesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted that he was “considering” taking the Silicon Valley car maker private at $420 a share.
Shares were halted about one hour later for pending news.
“Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,” Musk wrote. He would follow that up with yet another tweet to explain that a sale wouldn’t be happening. “I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario,” Musk shared.
In the interim, trading has been halted on shares of Tesla.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $367.25 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $25.26 (+7.39%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 17.95%, versus a 8.01% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-08-06,Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO Warned Short-Sellers They Would Be in for Financial Pain,3,348.17,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-ceo-warned-short-sellers-they-would-be-in/,"
Short sellers can’t claim that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk didn’t warn them. Musk has predicted that those wagering on his company’s demise would wind up being profoundly disappointed, and a recent spike in shares of the automaker have proven him to be correct for the time being. more
Marketwatch has the details on the pain for Tesla short sellers.
Investors who are betting that Tesla Inc. shares are poised for a fall were sitting on a paper loss of nearly $2 billion Thursday, after the stock rallied more than 16% following its latest quarterly earnings.
Tesla short sellers were down $1.7 billion in mark-to-market losses on the 35.1 million Tesla shares that they have shorted, according to S3 Partners LLC, a company that has access to and tracks real-time short interest data.
While Tesla posted an adjusted loss that was larger than anticipated by analysts – $3.06 a share vs. analyst expectations of $2.88 – Musk impressed on the earnings call. There were positive notes about the path ahead for the company, good news on the production front, and he reiterated that he has no intention to raise additional capital anytime soon.
He also apologized for his behavior on a previous call with analysts in which he engaged in boorish behavior. The market liked what it heard, and short sellers are reassessing their positions as a result.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $352.25 per share on Monday morning, up $4.08 (+1.17%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 13.14%, versus a 7.19% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the toast of the town on Wall Street – at least for the time being. A ton of effusive praise has been sent in the direction of the automaker and CEO Elon Musk in the wake of a solid earnings call, including from CNBC’s Jim Cramer. more
CNBC passes along Cramer’s bullish assessment of Tesla.
CNBC’s Jim Cramer gives billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk high marks for recognizing the need to apologize to the Tesla analysts he dissed three months ago.
On Wednesday’s post-results conference call, Musk said, “My apologies for not being polite on the prior call.”
The Tesla chief struck an apologetic tone with analysts for his rude behavior on a previous earnings call. He also promised profitability was an achievable goal for the electric vehicle maker while reiterating he foresees no need to raise additional funds at this time.
“Damn this was a good call,” Cramer said.” “This was the most thorough, most reasoned, most sane conference call he’s ever given.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $349.54 per share on Thursday afternoon, up $48.70 (+16.19%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 12.27%, versus a 6.72% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-08-02,Analyst Price Target Hikes for Tesla Inc (TSLA) as Production Looks to be on Track,3,300.84,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-analyst-price-target-hikes-for-tesla-inc-tsla-as-production/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is feeling the love from Wall Street in the wake of earnings. That’s true on both the share price front and with enthusiastic takes from those who are tasked with covering the automaker.  more
Investor’s Business Daily has some insight into the positive vibe surrounding Tesla.
Tesla stock soared Thursday after the electric-car maker received upgrades and a price-target increase on quarterly results that indicated Model 3 production will bring profits and help the company avoid further cash infusions.
Shares of Tesla (TSLA) jumped 12.7%, near 339.25, during afternoon trading on the stock market today. Tesla stock rose above its 50-day and 200-day moving average, which are bullish indicators.
Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch is among those that have upgraded Tesla in the wake of Wednesday’s earnings. He moved his rating from perform to outperform and boosted his price target to $385.
“While we have been cautious on Model 3 ramp, we believe gross-margin performance on Model 3 will carry the stock over the next 12 months,” he wrote. “With higher volumes and slower spending, we believe Tesla has reached a critical inflection point in its development.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $344.81 per share on Thursday afternoon, up $43.97 (+14.62%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 10.75%, versus a 6.66% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-08-02,Former Solar City Employees Accuse Tesla Inc (TSLA) of Accounting Shenanigans,3,300.84,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-former-solar-city-employees-accuse-tesla-inc-tsla-of-accounting/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing a wrongful-termination suit from a trio of former Solar City employees. The aggrieved ex-workers are also claiming that Solar City’s accounting practices leave a whole lot to be desired.   more
Marketwatch has the details on the suit that Tesla is facing.
Three former SolarCity Corp. employees have filed a wrongful-termination suit against the company and Tesla Inc., alleging they witnessed wrongdoing that included the practice of creating fake sales accounts to inflate the books.
The San Diego-area plaintiffs, two men and a woman who said they worked as energy consultants, allege that the fake accounts created were used to justify bonuses for those employees involved, and also to justify “an unreasonably high valuation of SolarCity,” according to a copy of the complaint, filed last week in San Diego Superior Court.
Tesla, which acquired Solar City in 2016 for $2.6 billion, has denied the allegations. The company contends that it fully investigated the claims of false sales records and didn’t find any facts to support the allegations.
The former workers have brought a litany of other claims to the table via the suit, including allegations that they were harassed and discriminated against.
Tesla Inc shares rose $30.16 (+10.03%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 6.27%, versus a 5.60% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk struck an apologetic and optimistic tone with analysts on the company’s second quarter earnings call, and that helped to offset the news that the company posted a larger than expected loss. Among the many tidbits that Musk had to share were some that reaffirmed that the company is doing alright on the cash flow front for now.  more
CNBC has the news on Tesla’s earnings call.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk sees no need for his electric car company to raise cash by selling stock and said that a new factory in China will likely be funded with a loan from a local bank.
“We will not be raising equity at any point,” Musk said during Tesla’s second quarter earnings call on Wednesday. “I have no expectation of doing so, do not plan to do so.”
The automaker has a massive cash burn rate, and that has naturally been a point of concern for investors. Musk indicated that the company will be cash flow positive in Q3, and added that the company continues to improve margins while cutting costs.
Musk also explained that the planned gigafactory in China will be funded with “local debt.” That factory would be operational in two years in a best case scenario, and Tesla believes it will produce 500,000 vehicles a year at full efficiency.
Tesla Inc shares rose $26.65 (+8.86%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.38%, versus a 6.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

While delivering its quarterly earnings report, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) noted that its stated Model 3 weekly production goal is being consistently met. The company is now looking to kick things up a notch as a result. more
CNBC shares the details of Tesla’s new plans.
Tesla said in a second quarter earnings update on Wednesday that it has repeatedly produced 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans in a week. Previously, the company said it would have to hit a weekly run-rate of 5,000 Model 3’s to become profitable, long-term.
Tesla made 53,339 vehicles in the second quarter, delivering 22,319 Model S and Model X vehicles and 18,449 Model 3 vehicles to customers, totaling 40,768 deliveries, according to the earnings release.
The company announced that it’s now shooting for a target of 6,000 Model 3’s per week by the end of August. Tesla also notes that it will be able to hit that mark without building any additional production lines, but they will need to tend to bottlenecks in the current configuration.
Tesla’s optimism on the future was enough to offset a larger than expected loss for the quarter in the eyes of investors.
Tesla Inc shares rose $24.66 (+8.20%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.38%, versus a 6.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) delivered its quarterly earnings report after the bell on Wednesday, and the automaker posted a bigger loss than expected. However, that bad news was offset by an optimistic look at the future. more
CNBC has the details on Tesla’s earnings report.
With a pledge of future profitability and an apology for past bad manners, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was upbeat in his conversation with analysts during a second-quarter conference call Wednesday.
Tesla shares soared as much as 11 percent in after-hours trading. The stock has been under pressure for some time as investors have worried about the cash the company was burning and whether it would be able to sustain its profitability.
Tesla recorded a loss of $3.06 per share for the quarter. Thomson Reuters estimates called for a loss of only $2.92 per share. The company notes that it has been able to consistently achieve its stated production goal of 5,000 Model 3’s per week, and it now has its sights set on hitting 6,000 per week.
In other positive news, CEO Elon Musk struck an apologetic tone while offering up a mea culpa for his rude behavior on a previous call with analysts. He also notes that the company has no plans to raise additional capital “at any point,” a comment that should put speculation on the company’s cash flow issues to bed for the time being.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is scheduled to report earnings after the bell today. As per usual with heavily-watched company, there are a whole lot of questions that need answering, including much-anticipated updates on production goals.  more
Marketwatch has a preview of what to expect from Tesla.
The question for Tesla investors may not be asked during the post-results call but it’s increasingly pertinent: Are Musk’s outbursts against analysts, the media, critics and others mere distractions for Tesla, or are they signs of more serious problems at the Silicon Valley auto maker?
Tesla long has been a polarizing stock, and the bear vs. bull needle is unlikely to move much either way when it releases second-quarter numbers on Aug. 1.
Musk has a proclivity for taking to Twitter to get things off of his chest, and critics are typically quick to pounce on him even harder after he does so. It’s unclear if that’s going to change, but we will have some clarity on where things stand with the company as a whole once earnings are in.
FactSet estimates are calling for the company to report sales of $3.99 billion and an adjusted loss of $2.88 per share for the quarter.
Tesla Inc shares rose $0.86 (+0.29%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.24%, versus a 6.32% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is due to report earnings on Wednesday, and that comes as the company continues to ramp up efforts to sustain its lofty production goals. Reports indicate that Tesla is taking an all hands on deck approach towards making that happen. more
CNBC has the news on Tesla’s production push.
Electric vehicle maker Tesla is taking urgent steps to add workers to its vehicle and battery plants, including flying employees in from out of state and putting them up in hotels, and temporarily enlisting employees from unrelated divisions.
Extra hands are welcome at the factory as Tesla strives to produce 5,000 or more Model 3 sedans each week — a number the company says it must sustain to become profitable long-term. However, shifting employees to work in the factory strains budgets and other business units, according to seven current and former employees. Some of these people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to press.
As production questions continue to loom large over the company’s collective head, so to do inquiries about the company’s fiscal health. There have been a ton of negative headlines out there that suggest Elon Musk and company will be raising cash again before too long. As for reports about the increased production efforts, the automaker released a statement acknowledging what it was doing.
“We’ve historically encouraged employees from around the company who want to assist in delivering vehicles or helping out in the factory towards the end of the quarter,” the statement read in part. “This is purely voluntary and intended to help give employees in different departments a firsthand look at what goes into building and delivering our vehicles.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $296.03 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $5.86 (+2.02%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.92%, versus a 6.28% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is considering building a gigafactory in Europe. That’s the word from a new report that has hit the wire, which indicates that the electric vehicle maker has already had discussions with two different countries.  more
Reuters shares the report making the rounds about Tesla.
Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is in talks with authorities in Germany and the Netherlands to build its first major European factory, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing officials involved in the matter.
The electric vehicle maker has had preliminary discussions with two German states vying to host its Gigafactory in Europe to build cars and their batteries under one roof, the Journal reported.
The report notes that the talks are in the early stages and that there’s no guarantee a deal will be reached. Tesla’s European ambitions have already been acknowledged, including via one of CEO Elon Musk’s tweets from back in June.
“Germany is a leading choice for Europe. Perhaps on the German-French border makes sense, near the Benelux countries,” Musk wrote.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $290.17 per share on Monday afternoon, down $7.01 (-2.36%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -6.80%, versus a 5.80% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) checks in with earnings on Wednesday, and one Wall Street firm is reaffirming its rating in anticipation of that. UBS is sticking to its sell rating for the electric vehicle maker. more
CNBC shares the firm’s take on Tesla.
Tesla shares will fall significantly because the company will not be profitable in 2019, according to UBS.
The firm reaffirmed its sell rating for Tesla shares, predicting the carmaker will report second-quarter earnings per share below expectations.
Analyst Colin Langan shared additional insight into the firm’s feelings on Tesla in a note to clients. “We are cautious on TSLA Q2 results … Q2 results [will] likely highlight cash flow and profit challenges,” he wrote. “The market should not ignore fundamental headwinds that persist with regards to TSLA’s Model 3 profitability, stationary storage, and solar … we believe TSLA will eventually need additional outside funding.”
The firm has also reaffirmed its price target of $195 for shares of Tesla.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $290.35 per share on Monday morning, down $6.83 (-2.30%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -6.74%, versus a 6.08% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-30,Goldman Sachs: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Customer Data Trending Negative Ahead of Earnings Report,2,297.18,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-goldman-sachs-tesla-inc-tsla-customer-data-trending-negative-ahead/,"
Customers and potential buyers just may not be that into Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) any longer. That’s one of the assessments of Goldman Sachs, which has taken a look at the electric vehicle maker in advance of earnings.  more
Street Insider shares Goldman’s take on Tesla.
Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino previewed Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) Q2 earnings due on Wednesday 8/1. The analyst said key focus areas revolve around (1) sustainability of Model 3 production, (2) pace and demand-variants of Model 3 order conversion, (3) margin improvement potential, and (4) FCF burn.
Tamberrino also highlighted that in collaboration with the Goldman Sachs Data Works team they introduce a new analysis on Model 3 sentiment based off social media posts. The data potentially points to waning customer enthusiasm for the vehicle as order availability and test drives have increased, he said.
Goldman Sachs has found that weekly posts on the Model 3 have declined from roughly 4,400 per week in 2016 to about 3,000 per week so far this year. Positive skew has also declined precipitously during the same period, from 18 percent to 4.5 percent.
The firm is standing by its sell rating and $195 price target for shares of Tesla.
Tesla Inc shares fell $2.92 (-0.98%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.55%, versus a 6.35% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-29,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Cash Problems Appear To Be Getting Worse,2,297.18,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-cash-problems-appear-to-be-getting-worse/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has had cash flow problems for a while, but these issues appear to be coming to a head.more
The electric automaker recently asked suppliers for a refund of a portion of its payment. As CNBC reports, this isn’t the sort of action that a financially secure company typically takes:
While automotive companies asking investors for cash back to support operations is a standard part of the negotiating process, Tesla has repeatedly said it doesn’t need the cash. However, the Sunday memo, in which the company asked investors to return a “meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016,” suggests otherwise and leaves market watchers wondering if Tesla is being truthful about its cash position.
The company lost about $2 billion last year and burned about $3.4 billion in cash after capital investments. At the end of March, Tesla had about $2.7 billion in cash.
Explaining the move, Tesla commented that “We asked fewer than 10 suppliers for a reduction in total capex project spend for long-term projects that began in 2016 but are still not complete, and any changes with these suppliers would improve our future cash flows, but not impact our ability to achieve profitability in Q3.”
Still, analysts don’t believe this one-time windfall will lead to sustainable profits. That could take several more years, in fact — if it happens at all.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $297.18 on Friday, down $9.47 (-3.09%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.55%, versus a 6.35% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

We can add another name to the list of those who are short shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). A legendary portfolio manager who nailed the financial crisis well before many others even knew there was a storm a brewing has come forward with his concerns about the company. more
CNBC shares his take on Tesla.
Steve Eisman, the investor whose prescient financial crisis forecast was featured in “The Big Short,” is shorting electric automaker Tesla.
The portfolio manager called the company’s founder Elon Musk a “very smart man” but raised concern about the CEO’s ability to follow through on lofty ambitions.
Eisman is a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, and he recently shared some thoughts with Bloomberg Television. “He’s got execution problems,” Eisman said. “He’s nowhere in autonomous driving, as far as I can tell, and big competition is coming in his space next year.”
Eisman bet big bet against subprime mortgage securities before the market imploded in 2008, and he was proven to be right on the money with his call.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $302.44 per share on Friday morning, down $4.21 (-1.37%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.86%, versus a 7.04% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is in line to ramp up deliveries soon, and the carmaker’s share price will rise as a result. That’s the assessment of Nomura Instinet, which has reiterated its buy rating for Tesla shares.  more
CNBC shares the firm’s perspective on Tesla.
Tesla shares will rise as the electric car maker significantly ramps up its deliveries in the September quarter, according to Nomura Instinet.
The firm reiterated its buy rating for Tesla shares, predicting the company will report third-quarter sales results above expectations.
Analyst Romit Shah has reaffirmed his $450 price target for Tesla, and he has also boosted his Q3 sales estimates from $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. He provided additional details on the firm’s expectations in a note to clients.
“We expect improving fundamentals in Q3, consisting of a step-function up in revenue growth and positive operating leverage, driving shares higher,” Shah said. “If Tesla can execute to plan, we believe that the narrative around bankruptcy risk will go away, thereby reducing short interest and driving the stock higher.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $305.84 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $8.41 (+2.83%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -1.77%, versus a 6.88% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-25,Morgan Stanley: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Has Become Untradeable as Volatility Explodes,3,297.43,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-morgan-stanley-tesla-inc-tsla-has-become-untradeable-as-volatility/,"
The volatile swings in Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) share price makes trading the stock not worth the trouble at the moment. That’s the take from Morgan Stanley, which has shared some thoughts on the automaker’s unpredictability in a note to clients. more
Marketwatch shares the firm’s take on Tesla.
Volatility surrounding Tesla Inc. is making it “extremely challenging” to come out with a coherent trading strategy for the stock at the moment, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Tuesday.
The analysts, led by Adam Jonas, kept their rating on Tesla TSLA, -1.90% stock their equivalent of neutral, saying the stock trades near its fair value amid recent volatility and that they’d “wait for the market to create better opportunity for investors to take a directional view.”
Morgan Stanley analysts explained that they have been peppered with inquiries from investors “about the unpredictable nature of Tesla management’s communications strategy.” Among the trouble spots that investors are looking for insight on are CEO Elon Musk’s highly-questionable behavior on social media, which the firm acknowledges is part of what makes the environment around Tesla so volatile.
“In recent weeks, the subject matter seems to have, at times, strayed away from the business and, as such, has become increasingly difficult for investors to defend,” the analysts wrote.
Tesla Inc shares fell $2.93 (-0.99%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.46%, versus a 6.23% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is dealing with the aftereffects of yet another memo that has made its way into the hands of the press. The latest leak has to do with the vehicle maker requesting retroactive discounts from a supplier.   more
CNBC has the details on the latest scuttlebutt surrounding Tesla.
In its report Sunday, The Wall Street Journal cited a Tesla memo asking a supplier last week to return a “meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016.”
The memo said all suppliers were being asked to help Tesla become profitable, the newspaper said, but added that it was unclear how many were asked for retroactive discounts.
There have been plenty of rumblings that suggest Tesla is hemorrhaging cash, and this report isn’t going to help quell those concerns. The WSJ notes that other suppliers were contacted for its report, and none of them indicated awareness of the request.
No comment has been forthcoming from Tesla as of yet.
Tesla Inc shares fell $10.46 (-3.34%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.43%, versus a 5.64% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) batteries could become collateral damage of ongoing US trade issues and sanctions. Concerns have emerged over the sourcing of a key battery component, and that may throw a wrench into the supply chain. more
CNBC has the details on a potential storm that’s looming on Tesla’s radar.
Panasonic said it was unable to determine how much of the cobalt used in batteries it makes for Tesla cars comes from Cuba, a country subject to U.S. sanctions, and that it had suspended relations with a Canadian supplier as a result of its concerns.
The Japanese electronics giant, the exclusive supplier of batteries to Tesla, made the comments following questions from Reuters about whether the batteries contained Cuban cobalt.
Panasonic receives some of the cobalt it uses to make Tesla’s batteries from a Canadian supplier, which mines for the component in Cuba. The electronics heavyweight isn’t sure how big of an issue this may turn into “due to co-mingling of sources by its suppliers in several phases of manufacturing processes,” but the company is investigating.
“Panasonic has sought guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) regarding its interpretation of the scope of the U.S. ban on Cuban-origin imports,” a spokesperson for the company said.
Tesla Inc shares fell $13.08 (-4.17%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 0.72%, versus a 5.70% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is by far the most expensive automaker in history from a valuation standpoint, and JPMorgan sees major downside risk for the stock this year.more
CNBC has more details on the very bearish call that came this week:
The firm reaffirmed its underweight rating on Tesla shares, saying other automakers may price their electric cars aggressively.
Tesla has a “highly differentiated business model, appealing product portfolio, and leading-edge technology, which we believe are more than offset by above-average execution risk and valuation that seems to be pricing in a lot,” analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a note to clients Friday. “We have highlighted more concerns regarding increased competition, including from automakers looking to use the sale of battery electric vehicles to subsidize their more lucrative internal combustion engine portfolio vehicles from a legal, regulatory, and compliance perspective, rather than trying to generate profit on the sale of these battery electric vehicles in and of themselves.”
Brinkman has a $180 December 2018 price target on TSLA, which suggests a 44% downside from Thursday’s closing price. He sees downside risk in the automaker’s second quarter earnings numbers, which are due out on August 1, despite the fact that Tesla was finally able to reach its production target goal for the Model 3.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $313.58 on Friday, down $6.65 (-2.08%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 0.72%, versus a 5.70% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

As always, there are a ton of questions swirling around in regards to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Analysts are looking ahead to the company’s Q2 earnings report as the next potential spot to gain additional clarity on the company’s progress – or lack thereof. more
Marketwatch has a preview of what to expect from Tesla.
The question for Tesla investors may not be asked during the post-results call but it’s increasingly pertinent: Are Musk’s outbursts against analysts, the media, critics and others mere distractions for Tesla, or are they signs of more serious problems at the Silicon Valley auto maker?
Tesla long has been a polarizing stock, and the bear vs. bull needle is unlikely to move much either way when it releases second-quarter numbers on Aug. 1.
CEO Elon Musk is consistently in the headlines for commentary he shares on social media, and it’s getting to the point that observers are questioning his ability to lead the company due to some of the outbursts and other talking points he shares. Perhaps a solid quarter of results with muted commentary from Musk to boot will help to calm detractors for the short-term.
As for earnings results, analysts surveyed by FactSet are expecting sales of $4.10 billion and an adjusted loss of $2.77 a share.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $319.28 per share on Friday morning, down $0.95 (-0.30%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 2.55%, versus a 5.73% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has fallen out of favor with another Wall Street firm. Needham & Co has downgraded the stock and noted that it worries there may be a rise in cancellations for Model 3 orders. more
CNBC shares the firm’s take on Tesla.
Tesla shares fell on Thursday after Needham & Co downgraded the stock to sell from hold, citing a possible pick-up in Model 3 cancellations.
“Based on our checks, refunds are outpacing deposits as cancellations accelerate,” wrote analyst Rajvindra Gill in the note Thursday. “The reasons are varied: extended wait times, the expiration of the $7,500 credit, and unavailability of the $35k base model.”
The automaker made headlines earlier this month when opened up Model 3 sales to anyone that placed a $2,500 deposit, foregoing reservations in the process. While some observers believe that will lead to a boon in Model 3 sales, the Needham & Co. see things differently.
“In August ’17, TSLA cited a refund rate of 12%. Almost a year later, we believe it has doubled and outpaced deposits. Model 3 wait times are currently 4-12 months and with base model not available until mid-2019, consumers could wait until 2020,” Gill continued.
Tesla Inc shares fell $6.55 (-2.02%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 4.01%, versus a 6.22% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Short seller Jim Chanos has once again taken the time to share some thoughts about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Let’s just say that his impression of the billionaire entrepreneur hasn’t improved in the slightest. more
CNBC shares what Chanos had to say about the Tesla honcho.
Short seller Jim Chanos hit back at Elon Musk on Wednesday, accusing the billionaire entrepreneur of over-promising on Tesla and The Boring Co.’s capabilities.
“What bothers me is not so much the personal stuff and the personal attacks. I’m used to that. It’s the willingness to say things that I think he knows are a stretch, to be polite,” said Chanos, who has been betting against Tesla for years.
Earlier this month, Musk implied in one of his many posts on Twitter that Chanos was a source for some of the negative stories that have made the rounds about the company. Chanos has taken exception to that contention as well.
“We talk to journalists all the time. We have never received insider information from any journalist at any time, including Tesla. And we’ve never paid any journalists,” Chanos said. “These are serious charges. When you make serious charges, you ought to bring serious evidence.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $323.47 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $0.78 (+0.24%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 3.89%, versus a 6.25% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-18,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Tightening The Grip on Employees,3,322.69,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-tightening-the-grip-on-employees/,"
Just weeks after announcing plans to streamline its US workforce, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has made some tweaks to its attendance policy. Specifically, the electric vehicle maker has clarified its attendance policy for hourly workers. more
CNBC has the details on the changes that Tesla has implemented.
Tesla rolled out a new attendance policy for all U.S.-based hourly employees on July 1st, according to documentation shared with CNBC. The policy spells out specific penalties for lapses in attendance, and Tesla says it is meant to make it fairer — for instance, employees who are 10 minutes late won’t be penalized as harshly as those who are one hour late.
The changes to Tesla’s attendance policy come weeks after the electric vehicle maker announced plans to slash its salaried workforce by at least 9 percent, or about 4,000 workers. The company is pushing hard to ramp up the production of its Model 3 electric sedans, and to achieve positive cash flow and profitability in the second half of this year.
In a nutshell, the policy changes clarify expectations while outlining when managers can impose discipline for workers that are late. The company shared some additional insight when questioned about a leaked memo outlining the new policy by CNBC.
“Based on employee feedback, we’ve recently updated our attendance policy to be more fair and flexible. We’re appreciative of the hard work by our production teams, and regularly review policies to work for our employees. The policy update has been in the works for nearly two months and is similar to what you would find at other companies,” the company said.
Tesla Inc shares rose $2.81 (+0.87%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 3.64%, versus a 5.99% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #9 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.

2018-07-16,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Shares in Focus Following Unfortunate CEO Remarks,2,318.87,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-shares-in-focus-following-unfortunate-ceo-remarks/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is back in the spotlight yet again, and it has absolutely nothing to do with progress or lack of progress being made by the company. Instead, it once again has to do with Musk’s choice of words on social media. more
CNBC has the details on what the Tesla honcho said this time around.
Tesla’s stock fell Monday after a British diver involved in the mission to save 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach said he is considering legal action against Elon Musk because the company’s boss labeled him “pedo guy.”
Spelunker Vernon Unsworth had called a submarine crafted by a team of Musk’s technicians a “PR stunt.” Billionaire Musk suggested the vessel — made out of a SpaceX rocket part — could be used to assist rescuers in freeing the soccer team from a flooded cave system in Chiang Rai.
During an interview with CNN, Unsworth expressed his displeasure with Musk’s contribution. “He can stick his submarine where it hurts,” he said. “It just had absolutely no chance of working. He had no conception of what the cave passage was like.”
Unsworth was also less than pleased with Musk’s reply and choice of words, and he hasn’t ruled out considering legal action.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $309.51 per share on Monday morning, down $9.36 (-2.94%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.59%, versus a 5.62% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-16,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Tax Breaks Getting Close to Winding Down,3,318.87,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-tax-breaks-getting-close-to-winding-down/,"
Consumers that were hoping to benefit from a tax break for purchasing a new Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicle had better get a move on. Those breaks will be phased out soon, and that could have impacts on a number of different fronts. more
Motley Fool has the details on what that means for Tesla.
Americans who are hoping to buy a new Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are now on notice: The fat tax incentive that has helped boost Tesla’s U.S. sales will soon start winding down. According to an update from Tesla, the tax break will start phasing out at the beginning of 2019.
That has implications for car shoppers — and for Tesla’s shareholders. Here’s what we know.
Currently, US buyers of electric vehicles are eligible to receive a federal tax credit worth $7,500. However, that break begins to phase out once the maker of the vehicles sells 200,000 electric vehicles in the US.
Tesla expects to hit that mark sometime this year, which means the tax break will phase out two calendar quarters afterwards. While we don’t know exactly when that will be, we know that the break will be phasing out sometime in 2019 as a result.
Tesla Inc shares fell $7.62 (-2.39%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.27%, versus a 5.66% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-15,Stories Of Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model 3 Production Hell Continue To Trickle Out,3,318.87,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-stories-of-tesla-inc-tsla-model-3-production-hell-continue/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) originally planned to produce 200,000 Model 3 sedans by the end of 2017.more
When the year ended, it had only made 2,700 of them. Instead of producing a futuristic army of fast-working robots to assemble the electric cars, Tesla has relied heavily on manual labor — even fabricating parts by hand — in order to get the job done.
Now, as Bloomberg reports, it appears that workers endured some extremely tough conditions in order to meet a recent quota:
To battle exhaustion, employees drink copious amounts of Red Bull, sometimes provided free by Tesla. New employees develop what’s known as the “Tesla stare.” “They come in vibrant, energized,” says Mikey Catura, a Tesla production associate. “And then a couple weeks go by, and you’ll see them walking out of the building just staring out into space like zombies.”
Four current employees say the pressure they felt to avoid delays forced them to walk through raw sewage when it spilled onto the floor.
Meanwhile, Tesla’s employees are considering unionizing. Considering the conditions they’re forced to work in, that seems like a really good idea — and a potentially dangerous development for a company that doesn’t appear close to making a profit on the Model 3 any time soon.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $318.87 on Friday, up $2.16 (+0.68%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 2.42%, versus a 5.66% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

A former Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) employee alleges there are serious problems afoot with his former employer. This isn’t just sour grapes from a disgruntled ex-worker being distributed to random news outlets either, as the former employee has escalated the situation substantially.  more
Business Insider has the details on the latest trouble spot for Tesla.
Former Tesla employee Martin Tripp has filed a whistleblower tip with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which he alleges the company lied about Model 3 production numbers and put unsafe batteries in its cars, The Washington Post reports.
According to the Post, which spoke with Tripp’s attorney Stuart Meissner, the complaint repeats claims Tripp had previously made to Business Insider, including that Tesla used batteries with puncture holes in vehicles meant for consumers. Tesla has previously denied this claim.
In addition, the Post reports that Tripp is asserting that the electric vehicle maker inflated Model 3 production numbers by as much as 44 percent. No comment has been forthcoming from the SEC or Tesla as of yet.
Back in June, Tesla filed a suit against Tripp which alleged he hacked and distributed confidential company information.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has announced a change in plans that could result in additional interest in its Model 3 vehicles. The electric vehicle maker has scrapped reservation requirements while opening up sales throughout North America. more
CNBC shares the news on Tesla’s changes.
Tesla is taking orders for its Model 3 electric sedans throughout the U.S. and Canada, no reservations required.
Previously, would-be Model 3 owners had to put down a $1,000 deposit to secure a place in line to buy the car. Now, anyone in North America can order one via Tesla’s website.
New customers and reservation holders alike will still need to place a $2,500 deposit to move their orders forward. Those deposits become non-refundable once a VIN number is assigned to the ordered vehicle, which typically happens within a few days of ordering.
Tesla has also announced that orders for the Model 3 will be fulfilled in priority order based on a mix of factors, including date of order.

There have been some rumblings that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was looking towards substantially ramping up production in China, and we now have another clue that suggests the same. A report has emerged that Tesla is inching closer to committing to build a factory in Shanghai. more
CNBC has the details on Tesla’s reported plans.
Telsa is planning to build large new plant in China, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday.
Bloomberg said the company is due to sign a memorandum of understanding on the factory with “local entities” in Shanghai, according to its sources. The plant will have a capacity to make 500,000 vehicles per year, the media outlet reported.
Reuters followed up on that report by citing a local media report that says the electric vehicle maker has put pen to paper on agreements with the Shanghai municipal government, Shanghai Lingang Area Development Administration, and the Lingang Group. Those agreements would essentially provide a green light for the factory to open its doors.
No confirmation has been forthcoming from Tesla as of yet on its plans for the factory.

2018-07-09,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Forced to Raise Prices in China as Tariffs Begin,2,308.90,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-forced-to-raise-prices-in-china-as/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is already a major exporter of electric vehicles to China, and the company has designs on exporting even more. However, the company now finds itself caught in the middle of the looming trade war between the US and China.   more
As Electrek reports, the automaker has decided to increase prices as a result.
Over the weekend, the prices of the Model S and Model X were increased by 150,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan (~$22,600 to ~$37,600) depending on the version.
Those are significant price increases as the original 25% tariff was supposed to be reduced to 15%, but it was instead increased to 40% in retaliation for the US’s latest list of tariffs for Chinese products.
Tariffs have been increased to a whopping 40 percent as the trade war escalates. Tesla sold more than $2 billion in vehicles in China last year, and that number was only expected to go up. Now that prices have been increased, those expectations may change.
The company reportedly has designs on building a factory in China in the future.
Tesla Inc shares rose $2.85 (+0.92%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.79%, versus a 4.09% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-08,Bear Market For Tesla Inc (TSLA) Could Be Just Beginning,3,308.90,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-bear-market-for-tesla-inc-tsla-could-be-just-beginning/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dropped around 10% last week alone, and one prominent equity strategist believes there’s more trouble ahead.more
Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, explained his outlook on CNBC recently:
“If you go back two weeks it’s down about 17 or 18 percent and that’s been a second yellow flag for the stock,” Maley told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “The first one came in the first quarter when the stock broke down below its multiyear trend line going all the way back to 2012.”
Tesla first started selling off in March, breaking below an upward trend line stretching back to 2012 when its shares first began to accelerate. A recovery rally brought its stock up to a year-to-date high of $373.73 on June 18, but it has since dropped 17 percent. Its June rally took it back up to its trend line dating back to 2012 but did not break above it.
That failure to hit new highs is a major factor in the stock’s subsequent technical breakdown, Maley notes. However, TSLA still has a long way to drop before true red flags begin to emerge. If the shares break down below the $250 level, he says, then it will be time to panic.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $308.90 on Friday, down $0.26 (-0.08%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.79%, versus a 4.09% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may get beaten up and battered around from time to time, but long-term shareholders consistently lift the stock back up off of the mat. That’s the take from CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who notes that the company has an innate ability to weather the constant storms that it faces. more
CNBC shares Cramer’s take on Tesla.
Tesla seems to be able to weather negative headline after negative headline without any substantial decline because there are no “real sellers,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Thursday.
While the stock was under pressure Thursday after Tuesday’s 7 percent decline, Tesla has gained more than 200 percent in the past five years.
Tesla still stands as one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street. In recent times, there has been an absolute barrage of negative headlines on the company, and CEO Elon Musk hasn’t been shy about drawing a correlation between those two tidbits.
As Cramer notes, long-term shareholders of Tesla have been “unshakable” to date, and that’s bad news for the plethora of short sellers that are betting big against the company.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $306.50 per share on Friday morning, down $2.66 (-0.86%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -1.56%, versus a 3.54% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk isn’t shy about pushing back against critics, but a recent instance demonstrates that he knows how to take his medicine as well. However, for that to happen, those that are dishing out the medicine need to bring a certain amount of credibility to the table.  more
CNBC shares the details on something that made the Tesla chief perk up and pay attention.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has no reluctance in lashing out at journalists. Or Wall Street analysts. Or employees.
But when Consumer Reports opened its mouth about Tesla’s Model 3 sedan, Musk listened. He quickly went to work to resolve the issues the 82-year-old magazine raised with the latest Tesla model. The response was notable for its swiftness, and it spoke volumes about Consumer Reports’ influence.
Back in May, the publication noted that could not recommend the Tesla Model 3 over a braking issue. After a back-and-forth on Twitter, Musk assured CR that he would have it fixed, and he invited the mag to review the vehicle once some tweaks had been made.
That serves as a testament to the sway that the publication continues to hold over the car-buying public, but it should also serve as notice that Musk will play ball when he feels the criticism is warranted.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has kicked his war with the press up a notch. Musk has taken umbrage with another batch of negative reports that have made the rounds about his company, and he claims that some outlets and analysts are intentionally propagating negative stories.    more
CNBC has the details on the Tesla chief’s war of words with the press.
The Tesla CEO sounded off on Twitter at media organizations Reuters, Business Insider and CNBC. Musk accused both Reuters and Business Insider of publishing false or misleading stories. He also suggested that CNBC features analysts with poor prediction records.
Musk has criticized journalists in the past and has even said he plans to start an organization that rates reporters. The CEO has had a contentious history with the media and bristled at the amount of attention trained on Tesla from both reporters and investors.
Musk unloaded on Twitter to poke holes in a number of different stories that have been making the rounds. In one instance, he wondered aloud if a Business Insider reporter also happens to be a source for a noted short seller. “Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him & he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange,” he shared. “Is this true?
None of the outlets in question offered up comments in response to Musk’s tweets.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was able to meet its latest production goal, but a new report has emerged that says the company skipped a step in the testing phase while doing so. The company contends that it did so only because the test was redundant. more
CNBC has the details on the latest flap surrounding Tesla.
As it pushed to hit its electric vehicle production targets for the quarter, Tesla decided to skip “brake-and-roll” testing for its Model 3 sedans in its Fremont factory.
The news was first reported by Business Insider.
The company managed to meet a self-imposed deadline to produce 5,000 Model 3 cars in a week after several quarters of missing its goals.
The company explained to CNBC that it recently did away with this specific test. “Every car we build goes through rigorous quality checks and must meet exacting specifications, including brake tests. To be extremely clear, we drive *every* Model 3 on our test track to verify braking, torque, squeal and rattle,” the company said. “There are no exceptions.”
The company also confirmed that all vehicles are tested on-site for brakes and alignment after assembly is completed.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is celebrating the fact that the company has reached its latest Model 3 production goal, but a number of firms are less than impressed. We can include Goldman Sachs in that camp, as the investment giant has reiterated its sell rating. more
CNBC has the details on the lack of enthusiasm surrounding Tesla.
Several Wall Street firms are playing down Tesla’s Model 3 production milestone, remaining skeptical over the carmaker’s finances and demand trends.
Tesla said Monday it reached its one-week production goal of 5,000 Model 3 cars for the last week of the June quarter. But the company fell short on its second-quarter deliveries by posting 40,740 vehicles delivered versus the Wall Street consensus expectation of approximately 51,000.
Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino is standing firmly by his sell rating and $195 price target for Tesla. He explained the reasoning for his bearish sentiment in spite of the recent positive news in a note to clients.
“Model 3 deliveries did miss our bearish estimates and we see the incremental color on Model 3 net reservations (where the company showed its first declining data point) as incrementally negative,” he wrote.
Tesla Inc shares fell $2.10 (-0.63%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 6.92%, versus a 3.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Now that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has successfully met its latest production goal, the automaker is on the road to profitability in the coming months. That’s the word from Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, who shared with CNBC his prediction for how the next few months will go for Tesla. more
CNBC shares the analyst’s insight on Tesla.
Loup Ventures’ Gene Munster predicts the embattled automaker will be profitable by September.
CEO Elon Musk announced Tesla aims to produce 6,000 Model 3s per week by August, but Munster says September is a safer bet.
“This 5,000 production number was the first time in about nine months he’s gotten one right. I think it’s safe to always dial back what he’s saying, that’s why we think [Tesla’s] going to meet the production number by the end of the September quarter,” he said. Munster believes that Tesla will become profitable at that time, but he was also careful to temper expectations.
“If they hit that number, it’s going to equate to 48,000 model 3s produced in the September quarter. That should get them to profitability, slightly profitable,” he added. “It’s not going to be wildly profitable in September, I just want to warn everyone, but… it moves them in the right direction.”
Tesla Inc shares fell $3.82 (-1.14%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 7.62%, versus a 2.74% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-02,"Analyst: Sell Tesla Inc (TSLA), Production Spike is Unsustainable",3,342.95,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-analyst-sell-tesla-inc-tsla-production-spike-is-unsustainable/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has reached its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a single week, but one firm doesn’t believe the company will be able to sustain the pace. In fact, CFRA Research is so convinced of that theory that the firm has dropped its rating on the electric vehicle maker. more
CNBC shares the firm’s take on Tesla.
CFRA Research does not believe Tesla will be able to maintain its Model 3 production rate over the short term.
The firm lowered its rating to sell from hold for Tesla shares, citing the stock’s valuation.
Despite his assumption that Tesla will not reach its goals, analyst Efraim Levy is maintaining his $300 price target for the company. He has outlined his reasoning in a note to clients.
“After Herculean efforts and albeit a few hours after a self-imposed deadline, Tesla finally achieved its latest goal to reach production of 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week,” he wrote. “In the interim, we do not see this production rate as operationally or financially sustainable.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $338.76 per share on Monday afternoon, down $4.19 (-1.22%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 8.80%, versus a 2.29% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Several rough patches in 2018 have done a number on shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) this year, but the electric vehicle maker has bounced back each and every time. The company has been on an upward trajectory since its 2010 IPO, and the growth of its share price has been nothing short of staggering.     more
CNBC shares some insight into Tesla’s remarkable growth.
The company’s stock is up nearly 2,000 percent from its $17 per share initial public offering, which was held eight years ago on June 29, 2010.
The stock market is rewarding companies that have a believable narrative on how to survive in a rapidly changing world versus focusing on near-term profit streams. Companies’ current earnings are of little consequence, if their businesses get crushed by tech juggernauts like Amazon or Netflix in a few years.
The company has yet to record a profit on an annual basis, and its cash burn rate has been a regular point of concern. When you add in the various hits and misses on production goals, and it’s easy to see why there are some wicked stretches of volatility for Tesla shareholders.
However, long-term holders have been rewarded handsomely for sticking it out through the company’s various hiccups.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $360.72 per share on Monday morning, up $17.77 (+5.18%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 15.86%, versus a 1.90% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-07-02,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Finally Hits Model 3 Production Deadline (Barely),3,342.95,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-finally-hits-model-3-production-deadline-barely/,"
After several missed production goals, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) finally hit a self-imposed deadline on its Model 3 production line.more
That’s according to an exclusive Reuters report that broke on Sunday:
Tesla Inc nearly produced 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans in the last week of its second quarter, with the final car rolling off the assembly line on Sunday morning, several hours after the midnight goal set by Chief Executive Elon Musk, two workers at the factory told Reuters.
The 5,000th car finished final quality checks at the Fremont, California factory around 5 a.m. PDT (1200 GMT), one person said. It was not clear if Tesla could maintain that level of production for a longer period.
As is his custom, CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to thank his employees for hitting another milestone of 7,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in a week:
7000 cars, 7 days♥️ Tesla Team ♥️
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2018

The question now becomes: is this feat repeatable? Workers have reported round-the-clock “all hands on deck” conditions at the factory to hit the goals. We’ll have to wait and see.
Tesla Inc shares rose $18.05 (+5.26%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 10.15%, versus a 2.52% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is due to provide an update on Model 3 production numbers soon, and the floodgates of speculation have been open for weeks at this point. Sources at the company’s assembly plant have chimed in with their take, and those that believe Tesla will fall short now have some new ammunition for their arguments as a result.  more
Reuters has the scoop on what the Tesla employees had to say.
Tesla Inc is not producing enough Model 3s per shift to reach the 5,000 per week target that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said it would reach by Saturday, three line workers at the company’s Fremont, California, assembly plant told Reuters this week.
The company was able to assemble and paint 210 Model 3s during the first of two 12-hour shifts on Wednesday, one worker told Reuters. On one of two Monday shifts, the company produced 305 of the vehicles, another worker told Reuters. The number of vehicles assembled per shift is displayed for line workers in the plant.
There have been a countless number of reports that suggest Tesla is going to miss the mark, as well as a number of predictions from analysts that hit the same note. Musk has dismissed those takes several different times, and he contends that those predicting doom and gloom are off base.
The company had no comment on this latest report. We will have zero concrete clarity on whether or not Tesla is reaching its production goals until the company delivers its update.

2018-06-28,Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk Not Worried About Missing Production Estimates,2,344.50,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-ceo-elon-musk-not-worried-about-missing/,"
Another analyst has chimed in to speculate that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will probably miss production targets for its Model 3 sedan. CEO Elon Musk has responded on social media, and let’s just say that he expects a different outcome. more
Investor’s Business Daily has the details on the Tesla chief’s latest war of words.
Tesla (TSLA) stock was up for the second straight day Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk hit back at a Goldman Sachs report saying the electric-car manufacturer is likely to miss production numbers for its Model 3 sedan.
“They are in for a rude awakening :)” Musk wrote in response, in an email Tuesday. The only other text in the email was a link to the CNBC story about the report, CNBC said.
Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino offered up his opinion that Model 3 deliveries are tracking below consensus estimates. As he sees it, the electric vehicle maker will deliver 22,000 Model 3’s in Q2, less than expectations of 28,000.
The analyst has a sell rating and a $195 price target on sales of Tesla. Musk hasn’t been shy about pushing back on analyst speculation and projections in recent times. Tesla is expected to report Q2 production and delivery numbers in the beginning of July.
Tesla Inc shares rose $4.50 (+1.31%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 10.65%, versus a 1.79% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-06-27,Tesla Inc's (TSLA) Opportunity in India to Go Beyond Just Cars,3,342.00,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-incs-tsla-opportunity-in-india-to-go-beyond-just/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may very well have a massive opportunity at hand in India, and it may go beyond electric vehicles. CEO Elon Musk has indicated he’s leaning on the company’s Indian-born chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja for clarity on when to enter the market and in what form, and scuttlebutt suggests the latter has his eyes on a different approach for the massive market. more
CNBC has some insight on Tesla’s potential plans.
A Tesla spokesman put it more simply, saying Ahuja has an important role in these types of strategic decisions, including whether and when Tesla expands into new markets.
Wadhwa said he had urged Musk to accelerate the move to India but not to rush into selling cars. Instead, he thinks India has a sizeable need for Tesla’s Powerwall home battery, and that’s a more attractive business proposition for Tesla in India than its cars. “This is where the biggest opportunity is,” he said. “The battery when combined with solar cells can solve one of the biggest problems that Indians face — the lack of reliable power.”
On Twitter recently, Musk shared some thoughts on what the future may hold for the company in India. “Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should,” he wrote.
However, it should be noted that Musk has recently taken the time to explain that his posts shouldn’t be treated as gospel. “Don’t take my Tweet too seriously,” he shared. “For one thing, it’s called a “Tweet”.”

2018-06-27,Goldman Sachs: Sell Tesla Inc (TSLA) Amid Yet Another Expected Model 3 Delivery Miss,3,342.00,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-goldman-sachs-sell-tesla-inc-tsla-amid-yet-another-expected/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is likely to miss expectations for Model 3 production and deliveries for the second quarter, and investors should avoid the stock as a result.more
That’s according to Goldman Sachs, which reiterated its Sell rating on the electric automaker this week. CNBC has more details on the bearish call:
Tesla is expected to release its second-quarter production and delivery numbers in the first few days of July. Goldman analyst David Tamberrino expects the company to report it delivered 22,000 units of its Model 3 mid-size electric sedan, which is up from his previous estimate of 19,000 cars, but still several thousand units below an analyst consensus of 28,000. He bases this estimate on data from InsideEVs.com, GreenCarReports.com, and registration bureaus in various European countries.
And though Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said it is “quite likely” the company will hit its goal of making 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a single week by the end of June, Tamberrino wonders how sustainable that rates is.
The good news is, Tamberrino expects deliveries of the Model S and Model X — Tesla’s higher-priced vehicles — to rise 4% and 5% respectively over last year’s levels. That estimate is slightly ahead of the Wall Street consensus estimate.
Still, investors are likely to focus almost solely on Model 3 numbers. The low-priced EV represents all the hopes of the company’s mass market future, and until Tesla’s able to demonstrate solid production gains, the stock will likely endure a major cap on its upside.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is suing a former employee, Martin Tripp, for allegedly stealing MOS factory software and transferring massive amounts of data to outside sources.more
Tripp denies the charges, which could land him in jail if found guilty. So, what is MOS software, anyway? CNBC has the answer:
First, this is not software that’s installed in Tesla’s vehicles. If anyone modified MOS code, they were not changing the code embedded on chips in Tesla’s cars.
Rather, Tesla built its MOS software to automate factory processes for assembling the Model 3, its newest vehicle. In general, MOS is used to track where a Model 3 is in the process of manufacturing, repairs and testing.
It’s important to note that the software in question has nothing to do with Tesla’s vehicles themselves. Instead, it’s factor software used to manufacture the cars — not operate the cars’ systems or self-driving capabilities.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $333.63 on Friday, down $13.88 (-3.99%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 7.16%, versus a 3.83% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors hoping for its burgeoning services unit to drive meaningful upside in coming years might be disappointed.more
That’s according to one prominent Wall Street analyst, who issued some cautious commentary about the electric automaker’s shrinking margins within the segment. CNBC has more details:
Bernstein reiterated its market perform rating on Tesla shares, citing its concerns over the electric car maker’s declining profit margin in its “Services and Other” business segment.
“Tesla reports revenues and gross margins each quarter for its ‘Automotive’ and ‘Services and Other’ segments. Interestingly, ‘Services and Other’ gross margins have steeply plunged in recent quarters,” analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note to clients Friday entitled “Services margins are plummeting… does this mean automotive gross margins could be overstated?” “The worry/key question, of course, is whether COGs that should be (or historically have been) booked in the Automotive Segment are now being booked in the ‘Services and Other’ reporting segment, given that investors focus nearly exclusively on Automotive GMs & generally disregard ‘Services and Other’ GMs [gross margins].”
Sacconaghi also reiterated his $285 price target on Tesla shares, which suggest a 24% downside from current levels. He noted that Tesla’s gross profit margin for its Services and Other united plunged to a negative 45 percent in its first quarter of 2018, versus a positive 5 percent Q3 of 2016.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is in line to face stiff competition in the electric vehicle market next year. As analysts from Oppenheimer point out, a number of legacy car makers will be entering the market next year.  more
Marketwatch has the details on the competition Tesla will be facing.
Tesla Inc. will face the first true test of its position in the electric vehicle market in 2019, as competition from legacy car makers, including Jaguar, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes, heats up.
That’s the view of Oppenheimer analysts in a note published ahead of two Tesla bull/bear lunches that they plan to host in New York this week.
Analysts led by Colin Rusch shared their take on what it means for Tesla in a note to clients. “We continue to believe that sustainable disruption in the transportation market both from the fuel and autonomy perspectives is what is at stake for Tesla shares,” the analysts wrote. “In other words, is Tesla going to be the dominant force in the transport market or one of many actors?”
Oppenheimer currently has a perform rating on shares of Tesla, and the firm will be watching closely to see how the electric vehicle maker navigates its way through the remainder of 2018.

2018-06-22,Tesla Inc (TSLA) is Reported to Make Cuts in its Solar Division,3,347.51,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-is-reported-to-make-cuts-in-its/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) made headlines last week with the announcement that it would be reducing its workforce by nine percent. A new report has emerged that points out the job cuts aren’t just happening at the company’s electric vehicle division. more
Business Insider has the details on where the cuts are happening at Tesla.
Electric car maker Tesla’s move last week to cut 9 percent of its workforce will sharply downsize the residential solar business it bought two years ago in a controversial $2.6 billion deal, according to three internal company documents and seven current and former Tesla solar employees.
The latest cuts to the division that was once SolarCity – a sales and installation company founded by two cousins of Tesla CEO Elon Musk – include closing about a dozen installation facilities, according to internal company documents, and ending a retail partnership with Home Depot Inc that the current and former employees said generated about half of its sales.
Tesla has not provided confirmation on what percentage of the solar workforce would be losing their jobs or which installation locations were on the chopping block. However, the company did provide a basic statement about its plans to Reuters.
“We continue to expect that Tesla’s solar and battery business will be the same size as automotive over the long term,” the statement read in part.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has a habit of dropping company news on Twitter, and he just shared another interesting tidbit in response to a user question. Musk has shared which country is the leading candidate to be home to the company’s planned gigafactory in Europe. more
Marketwatch has the news on where Tesla may be headed.
Elon Musk, apparently undeterred by President Donald Trump’s warnings of rising crime, said Tuesday he is eyeing Germany as a potential site for Tesla Inc.’s planned European Gigafactory.
In a Tweet response to a question from a follower, the Tesla TSLA, -0.05% chief said Germany is a leading choice for the factory, which is expected to produce lithium-ion batteries that can be used in electric cars.

No specific timeline has been unveiled for Tesla’s European factory ambitions.

2018-06-20,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Suing Former Employee Over Trade Secret Information Theft,2,362.22,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-company-suing-a-former-employee-for-allegedly-hacking-trade-secrets/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has filed a lawsuit against a former employee over trade secret theft. The suit alleges that the former worker hacked confidential company info and shared it with third parties. more
Techcrunch has the details on Tesla’s case.
Tesla is suing a former employee for $1 million, alleging the man hacked the company’s confidential and trade secret information and transferred that information to third parties, according to court documents. The lawsuit also claims the employee leaked false information to the media.
The lawsuit against the former process technician Martin Tripp was filed Wednesday in Nevada. Tesla declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was first reported by CNBC.
According to the suit, Tripp “admitted to writing software that hacked Tesla’s manufacturing operating system (“MOS”) and to transferring several gigabytes of Tesla data to outside entities.” CEO Elon Musk has recently shared some ominous posts on social media about rogue employees, and he shared another today that indicates there could be more revelations to come.
“There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That’s still ~40 people,” Musk shared.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $362.22 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $9.67 (+2.74%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 16.34%, versus a 3.84% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

If nothing else, the news surrounding Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) tends to fall on the interesting side. Another story has emerged that certainly falls into that category, as it includes references to conspiracy and sabotage that have impacted the electric vehicle maker’s operations.   more
CNBC shares the details on this eyebrow-raising story about Tesla.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to all employees on Monday morning about a factory fire, and seemed to reference possible sabotage.
Now, CNBC has learned that Musk also sent an e-mail to all employees at Tesla late on Sunday night alleging that he has discovered a saboteur in the company’s ranks.
According to Musk, the rogue employee is responsible for “quite extensive and damaging sabotage.” In the email to employees, he accuses the unnamed employee of “making direct code changes to the Tesla Manufacturing Operating System under false usernames and exporting large amounts of highly sensitive Tesla data to unknown third parties.”
Musk explained to employees that the investigation is ongoing and that he will keep them posted on developments as they arise.

2018-06-18,Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk Issues New Warning to Short-Sellers,3,358.17,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-ceo-elon-musk-issues-new-warning-to/,"
As Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sees it, short sellers are playing with fire by betting against his company. He hopped on social media over the weekend to advise that their positions may be in peril over the next few weeks. more
CNBC shares Musk’s warning for Tesla short sellers.
Tesla CEO and chairman Elon Musk went after shorts on Twitter over the weekend. He generally warned investors selling his electric vehicle venture short that they have about 3 weeks to cover if they don’t want to lose their money.
Tesla stock has rallied more than 20 percent since the company’s early June annual shareholder meeting at which Chairman and CEO Elon Muskpromised profitability in the third quarter, and trended more than 4 percent higher through last week after Tesla announced layoffs on Tuesday June 12th. Last week, Elon Musk bought around 72,000 Tesla shares, spending nearly $25 million to do so.
“They have about three weeks before their short position explodes,” Musk wrote. There has been a lot of volatility in Tesla share prices this year, much of which has been a direct result of negative headlines.
Musk hasn’t been shy about pushing back against those headlines, and the market seems to be agreeing with him lately. We’ll have to wait and see if that lasts if another batch of negative headlines hits the wires.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $368.64 per share on Monday afternoon, up $10.47 (+2.92%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 18.40%, versus a 3.92% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains one of the most shorted stocks on the street, but CEO Elon Musk hasn’t been shy about pushing back against those bets. According to one financial pundit, what he’s been doing is working like a charm.  more
CNBC has some insight into the Tesla CEO’s response for short sellers.
Elon Musk is “masterful” in the way he fights back against the short sellers of Tesla stock, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Thursday.
“You can’t lay a glove on him [Musk]. He floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee,” said Cramer, paraphrasing the famous quote from the late boxer Muhammad Ali.
Just last week, an SEC filing revealed that Musk had snapped up another 72,500 shares of the electric automaker. This comes in the wake of a number of negative headlines, many of which Musk has personally pushed back against, including questions about the company’s productivity and cash flow position. As Cramer sees it, Musk has been providing a clinic on how to respond to shorts.
“I remember when I was a hedge fund manager there periodically would be these companies where they knew how to handle the shorts,” Cramer added. “No one has been as masterful. Elon Musk is masterful. He’ll take the shorts up there with his rocket to Mars.”
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.92 (-0.54%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 15.04%, versus a 4.26% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-06-15,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Layoffs All About the Company’s Cash Crunch,3,357.72,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-layoffs-all-about-the-companys-cash-crunch/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has announced that it will be reducing its workforce by 9 percent, and reaction has been mixed. CEO Elon Musk has referred to it as a simple restructuring, but some critics believes it has more to do with the company’s cash problems. more
Business Insider has some insight into the situation at hand for Tesla.
The layoffs Tesla announced Tuesday shouldn’t come as a surprise. Similarly, you shouldn’t be shocked if the company makes other dramatic moves in the coming months.
You see, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is caught in a kind of bind. His company is hemorrhaging cash as it has been struggling to ramp up production of its new Model 3 car. The company has said it won’t start generating profits from the vehicle until it’s making 5,000 of them a week; at last check, it could sustainably make only 3,500 a week.
Investors have taken notice of Tesla’s seemingly unquenchable thirst for cash, and plenty of concerns have been raised about whether the company will be able to continue at its current cash burn rate. That’s led to a belief that the company will have to raise capital again, but Musk believes the company will be generating positive cash flow by Q3.
Only time will tell which perspective is correct on Tesla, but you can rest assured that a ton of analysts have their eyes on the company to pounce on red flags as they emerge.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $355.64 per share on Friday morning, down $2.08 (-0.58%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 14.23%, versus a 3.78% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-06-15,Short-Sellers Remain Defiant in Battle Against Tesla Inc (TSLA),3,357.72,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-short-sellers-remain-defiant-in-battle-against-tesla-inc-tsla/,"
There has been plenty of volatility in shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) this year, but the negative sentiment that surrounded the company for much of it seems to be leveling out. However, some investors are standing firm in their position that all is not well with the electric vehicle maker.  more
CNBC has the details on short seller sentiment on Tesla.
It’s been a rough few weeks for investors betting against Tesla, one of the most-shortedstocks in the United States.
Tesla stock has rallied almost 17 percent since the company’s early June annual shareholder meeting at which Chairman and CEO Elon Musk promised profitability in the third quarter. Shares kept trending higher this week, rising slightly after Tesla announced plans to lay off 9 percent of its workforce. Musk added $25 million worth of shares to his personal holdings.
Tesla’s recent restructuring and layoffs has been viewed as a positive by the market as a whole, but short sellers see another red flag. As they see it, it’s just further evidence that the company is in a cash crunch. What’s more, some short sellers believe Tesla will have a hard time getting their cash calls answered if they need to go that route.
Kynikos Associates founder Jim Chanos is among those in the bearish camp on Tesla, and he explained to CNBC what his concerns are with the company. “The company is not profitable from operations. The company will … do a lot of one-time items, we believe, to show a GAAP profit in the third quarter. But they are just that, one-time items,” he said. “The basic problem is that [Musk] is making the cars at not enough of a gross margin to make money — and that’s before the competition rolls out, which is late this year and early next year.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $353.60 per share on Friday morning, down $4.12 (-1.15%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 13.57%, versus a 3.98% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-06-14,Analyst: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model 3 Cancellation Rate Worse Than Wall Street Imagines,2,357.72,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-analyst-tesla-inc-tsla-model-3-cancellation-rate-worse-than/,"
While the general sentiment surrounding Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) seems to be trending back in the positive direction, not all analysts are completely convinced. We can add Vertical Group’s Gordon Johnson to the camp of the thoroughly unconvinced, as he has dropped his already street-low price target even lower. more
Zero Hedge passes along the analyst’s incredibly bearish take.
One main reason: according to Johnson’s calculations, the cancellation rate on Model 3 is a disastrous 66%, up 33% YTD, or as Gordon says, “Boy… that’s a Lot of Model 3 Cancellations.” Here are the details from Gordon:
Our work (Ex. 1) implies a 66% cancellation rate for the “euphoric” day-1 Model 3 reservations of ~140K. When applying this figure to our est. for 582K in gross reservations through mid-Apr. (i.e., 518K in gross reservations 7/31/17 + 7.55K/month in new reservations 7/31/17-to-4/15/18 [or 64K] to account for a monthly cancellation rate of 1% as of 7/31/17), we calculate sales from 582K in early Model 3 reservations of just 197K – we remind our readers that in mid-Apr. ’18, TSLA sent out configuration invites to US-based non-owners who made reservations one day after reservations opened up to the public (i.e., 4/1/16); from this, one can imply in mid-Apr. ’18 TSLA had fully exhausted Model 3 reservations made 3/31/16 (i.e., day one); furthermore, as of mid-Apr. ’18, all US-based owner reservations were complete.
In addition to showing his math for his estimated cancellation rate, Johnson has also provided a new valuation target for the electric vehicle maker. “Applying a 0.725x multiple to our new 2020 rev est. of $21.7bn (Street $34.7bn), our year-end 2019 price objective edges modestly lower to $93/share (-73% downside from today’s closing price) from $99/share previously.”
That would be a stunning drop – to say the least – from Tesla’s current price point. We’ll have to wait and see if Johnson’s crystal ball proves to be accurate or not.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $357.72 per share on Thursday afternoon, up $12.94 (+3.75%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 14.89%, versus a 4.87% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

As Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other automakers roll electric vehicles off the assembly line, demand for minerals used to make batteries naturally soars. That’s having a ripple effect in the mining industry, and one company is taking steps to deal with the spike. more
Investor’s Business Daily has the news on a mineral that has been flying off the shelves.
As Tesla (TSLA), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) accelerate electric vehicle production, Brazilian mining giant Vale (VALE) will invest roughly $1.54 billion to launch underground nickel mining operations in Canada to meet booming demand for minerals used in EV batteries.
Vale’s Voisey’s Bay nickel move came as that project was nearing the end of its open-pit life, Bloomberg said. The bet on underground mining will extend the life of the mine by 15 years and create 1,700 direct jobs. Construction is likely to start this summer, with operations kicking off in April 2021.
At the present time, electric vehicles account for roughly three percent of the auto market. According to industry forecasts, that number will surge to between 40 and 50 percent on a worldwide basis by 2040.
That should be good news for miners, and Vale is proactively getting ready.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $343.19 per share on Wednesday morning, up $0.42 (+0.12%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 10.23%, versus a 5.04% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has announced another change, and this one has nothing to do with its electric vehicles or solving any production issues. This time around, changes are coming to the solar side of the business. more
CNBC has the details on Tesla’s move.
Tesla is ditching Home Depot as a sales partner for its residential clean energy products, CEO Elon Musk revealed in an e-mail to his employees on Tuesday. The move is part of a broader restructuring of the company which also entails layoffs of about 9 percent of the Tesla workforce, not including hourly production associates involved in manufacturing.
Company CEO Elon Musk explained the decision in an email to employees. “In addition to this company-wide restructuring, we’ve decided not to renew our residential sales agreement with Home Depot in order to focus our efforts on selling solar power in Tesla stores and online,” he wrote. “The majority of Tesla employees working at Home Depot will be offered the opportunity to move over to Tesla retail locations.”
As for the layoffs, they are expected to begin this week and be wrapped up rather quickly.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has hinted that changes are coming to Tesla, and we now have clarity on what he meant by that. A big round of layoffs is on the horizon for the electric vehicle maker as it attempts to become leaner and more efficient.  more
Electrek has the news on Tesla.
Last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a vague plan to “restructure” the company in order to achieve profitability during the second half of the year.
Following the announcement, Electrek has now learned of a round of layoffs currently ongoing at Tesla, which could see as much as 9% of the workforce leave the company.
For round numbers, Tesla has more than 30,000 employees, which means that around 3,000 jobs could be eliminated when all is said and done. Musk provided more clarity on the decision making process in an email to employees.
“We made these decisions by evaluating the criticality of each position, whether certain jobs could be done more efficiently and productively, and by assessing the specific skills and abilities of each individual in the company,” he wrote. “As you know, we are also continuing to flatten our management structure to help us communicate better, eliminate bureaucracy and move faster.”

The sentiment seems to be shifting around sentiment Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Another firm has climbed on board the momentum train to share a positive note about the automaker. more
Marketwatch shares what the firm had to say about Tesla.
Tesla Inc.’s stock TSLA, +3.22% ran up 2.3% in premarket trade Tuesday toward a three-month high, after KeyBanc Capital raised its revenue expectations for the current quarter, citing evidence of a “meaningful ramp” in Model 3 volumes. “Based on our conversations with 20 sales centers across the U.S. (18% of total), we believe weekly run-rate volumes have moved from the high teens per store per week to the low 30s since our last checks in April,” analyst Brad Erikson wrote in a note to clients.
Erikson was initially expecting revenue of $3.91 billion for Tesla in Q2, but he has kicked those expectations up several notches to $4.37 billion. According to FactSet, consensus estimates are calling for  $4.23 billion.
“With three weeks to go in the quarter, we estimate the company is tracking to something between 30,000 and 35,000 Model 3 deliveries in the quarter versus our prior view of 20,000-25,000,” Erikson added.

Honda will “source” battery cells and modules from GM, the companies jointly announced in a news release Thursday. GM’s next-generation battery system will deliver more energy, be smaller than current technology, and charge more quickly, according to the release.
The battery will power both Honda’s future electric vehicles (EVs) and GM’s own, mainly for the North America market.
The move will no doubt reignite the rivalry between GM and Tesla, which produce the lion’s share of EVs sold in America. GM’s Chevy Volt has proven a solid — and perhaps more importantly, readily available — alternative to Tesla’s Model 3, which continues to have production issues. Both companies are angling to dominate the battery production market, which is seen as the key cog in the wheel of EV production in general.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $317.66 on Friday, up $1.57 (+0.50%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 2.03%, versus a 4.66% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #11 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.

2018-06-08,Technical Analyst Sees Bullish Move Ahead for Tesla Inc (TSLA),3,316.09,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-technical-analyst-sees-bullish-move-ahead-for-tesla-inc-tsla/,"
It has been a volatile ride for shareholders of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in recent months, but one analyst has a take that will bring a smile to their faces. According to the analyst, there’s a big bullish move ahead for the carmaker. more
CNBC shares the analyst’s take on Tesla.
A surge this week has Tesla racing back to levels not seen in three months and reversing a sell-off that had wiped out a year’s worth of gains. The charts suggest its comeback is just getting started, one technical analyst says.
“Tesla likes to consolidate and then thrust higher,” TradingAnalysis.com’s Todd Gordon told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “What we’ve seen over the last couple of years is Tesla’s big-time consolidation.”
Over the past three years, Tesla has come under heavy selling pressure on two separate occasions over concerns about the company’s fundamentals. Share prices navigated their way through both rough patches, and Gordon is targeting a move above $400 now that the latest rough patch seems to have subsided.
“As everyone was really coming down on Telsa on the fundamentals you can see that all we did was a 37 percent decline which was very much in line with the last decline, which was 34 percent. It’s actually very symmetrical, very technical, and very expected,” he added.
Tesla Inc shares rose $3.11 (+0.98%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 2.14%, versus a 4.17% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-06-07,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Short Sellers Humbled By Another Stock Rally,3,319.50,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-short-sellers-humbled-by-another-stock-rally/,"
Shorting Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) can sometimes be a profitable venture, but boy is it risky.more
The electric automaker’s stock had been a laggard for much of 2018, and actually hit a new 52-week low back in April. But a vote of confidence for CEO Elon Musk from shareholders at Tesla’s annual meeting late Tuesday, combined with Musk’s claim that it’s “extremely likely” Model 3 production will finally hit the 5,000 car per-month goal by the end of June, spiked the shares by almost 10%.
As CNBC reports, that move led to a lot of pain for short sellers:
Investors betting against Tesla lost more than $1 billion Wednesday as the company’s shares rallied the most in over two years, according to estimates from financial technology firm S3 Partners.
Tesla stock closed Wednesday up 9.7 percent at $319.50 per share, meaning investors who sold the stock short lost a collective $1.07 billion in a single day, estimates S3. Tesla bears have lost nearly $5 billion in mark-to-market losses since 2016, S3’s head of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky told CNBC.
Despite the risks, Tesla remains the most heavily shorted stock in the United States. Second on that list is Amazon, followed by Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet — a veritable who’s who of technology juggernauts.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.85 (-0.58%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 2.62%, versus a 4.37% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The negative headlines that have been surrounding Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in recent times have pointed to a company that appeared to be at a cross roads. We now have some clarity on what the path forward will be, and the market is reacting accordingly.  more
CNBC has the news that has led Tesla shares to pop.
Tesla stock rose more than 8 percent Wednesday, on track for its best day of trading in over two years, after the company revealed it is nearing its Model 3 weekly production rate and shareholders backed Elon Musk as chairman and CEO.
Musk told shareholders it is “extremely likely” Tesla will hit a weekly Model 3 production rate of 5,000 cars by the end of the month. Tesla has been struggling with production issues and faces concerns about its finances.
Reaching production goals for the Model 3 has been challenging for Tesla thus far, and Musk has had to adjust forecasts a number of different times as a result. Based on his comments at the shareholder meeting, it sounds like the troubles are a thing of the past.
To further bolster the enthusiasm surrounding the company at the moment, Tesla has announced plans to open a factory in Shanghai, its first outside of the US.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $316.51 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $25.38 (+8.72%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 1.66%, versus a 4.24% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-06-05,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Having to Come Up With More Model 3 Customer Refunds,4,296.74,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-having-to-come-up-with-more-model/,"
While anticipation remains high for Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3, enthusiasm has being tempered among some early reservation holders. In fact, nearly a quarter of deposits have been refunded as of April, according to one data analytics firm.  more
Investor’s Business Daily has additional details on Tesla’s deposit situation.
Reservation holders for a Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 are having second thoughts, as nearly a quarter are asking for their deposits to be refunded, according to a report Monday by data analytics firm Second Measure.
“Investors have good reason to be interested,” the company said in a blog post. “As of last quarter, more than a third of Tesla’s cash holdings were customer deposits.”
At the end of December, Tesla had $663.8 million in customer deposits on its balance sheet. Fast forward to Q1, and that number dropped to $616.4 million. According to Second Measure, 23% of deposits for the Model 3 have been refunded as of April.
However, eight percent of reservation holders have gone ahead and forwarded an additional $2,500 to Tesla for configuration options, a step which also locks in the initial deposit.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.87 (-0.63%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.69%, versus a 3.43% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

If nothing else, the news surrounding Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is generally not boring. It may get even more interesting on Tuesday, as Tesla chief Elon Musk could find himself in the hot seat. more
CNBC has the details on what could be an interesting day for Tesla shareholders.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk faces votes at Tuesday’s shareholder meeting that will challenge his grip on the electric carmaker, but he may be able to count on some powerful friends: big fund managers likely to be fans.
These stockpickers would have weighed Musk’s forceful public persona in their decisions to buy and hold Tesla shares in the first place, and likely are ready to back him at the meeting to be held in Mountain View, California, said analysts, corporate governance experts, and investors.
Overall concerns about the company’s production and other flaps regarding Musk’s management style have been in the headlines an awful lot in recent months. The question comes down to whether or not his vision outweighs the trouble at this point in time, as well as if he’s the right one to be guiding the ship through turbulent waters. According to Morningstar analyst David Whiston, the big investors will likely side with Musk.
“I doubt they would vote against Elon because if you don’t believe in Elon, why are you in the stock?” he said.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $296.80 per share on Monday afternoon, up $4.98 (+1.71%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.67%, versus a 3.41% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Some Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) workers are reporting multiple undisclosed fires at the electric automaker’s factory, perhaps calling into question the company’s dedication to safety and disclosing negative incidents.more
CNBC has more details on the interesting development:
Tesla has had at least four fires in the paint shop at its Fremont, California, factory since 2014, according to five people familiar with operations at that plant.
One previously reported fire, in April, was serious enough to stop Model 3 production for multiple shifts that week, these people said. Another fire took place in January 2016 and caused at least a day of suspended vehicle production. Both fires damaged expensive equipment.
The workers reportedly blame the fires on inadequate cleaning, insufficient maintenance, and a lack of proper training for new employees. These issues have grown amid extreme pressure from executives to meet lofty production goals, the people said.
For its part, Tesla downplayed the severity of the fires, and said it’s doing more to improve safety. “In recent months, we have further enhanced the safety and efficiency of our paint shop, including significant upgrades to equipment, as well as an extensive maintenance effort involving cleaning and calibration,” the company said in a statement.

2018-06-02,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model 3 Inches Toward Profitability,3,291.82,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-model-3-inches-toward-profitability/,"
Tesla Inc (TSLA) is famous for burning through cash at a rapid rate (and may have to raise more money very soon), but a new report notes that Model 3 profitability may be much closer than previously thought.more
BGR has more details on the interesting development:
Interestingly enough, if Tesla can really boost Model 3 production, the company may be able to generate more of a profit than most analysts seem to be expecting. To this point, Electrek points us to a new Model 3 teardown which reveals that the total cost of putting together a Model 3 (parts + labor) is approximately $28,000.
Margins in the auto-industry are notoriously slim, but the Model 3 could prove to be incredibly profitable for Tesla if production sees a massive boost. As Elon Musk intimated via Twitter recently, Model 3 shipments thus far are low enough that Tesla would lose money if the company only focused on delivering the minimum cost ($35,000) Model 3 as opposed to focusing on more expensive variants.
That means if and when Tesla can actually significantly ramp up Model 3 production, profitability could soon follow. The company has over 400,000 reservations for Model 3s waiting in the wings, so demand isn’t the issue — it’s that pesky production bottleneck that has been the bane of Elon Musk’s existence for the past several months.

2018-05-30,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Back in Good Spirits With Consumer Reports Following Software Update,4,283.76,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-back-in-good-spirits-with-consumer-reports/,"
Consumer Reports took a look at Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 a few weeks back, but the publication decided that it wouldn’t be able to slap a recommendation on the vehicle. Tesla responded by making some tweaks and asking CR to take another look, and that has proven too be a solid decision.    more
CNBC passes along a positive note for Tesla.
Consumer Reports said Wednesday it now recommends the Tesla Model 3, reversing an earlier decision over the car’s long stopping distance and other issues. The group said Tesla’s ability to fix the issue with a remote software update was a first for a carmaker.
Tesla improved the car’s braking distance by about 20 feet through a remote software update, placing the car within the typical stopping distance for its class, the group said. Consumer Reports had previously said the Model 3 had the longest stopping distance of any contemporary car it tested, including the much larger Ford F-150 full-size pickup.
Consumer Reports director of automotive testing Jake Fisher refers to the reversal of course as an “industry first.” CEO Elon Musk wasn’t real pleased that CR didn’t give the vehicle the nod, and that led to him essentially asking for a do-over if problems were addressed. The publication agreed, and CR is now comfortable enough to recommend the vehicle to its readers.
“Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise & ride comfort already addressed too,” Musk shared on Twitter. “UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $291.28 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $7.52 (+2.65%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -6.45%, versus a 2.68% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-30,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Pulling Out All Stops to Keep Model 3 Battery Production Going,3,283.76,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-pulling-out-all-stops-to-keep-model/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has its hands full with navigating its way through a number of different issues at the moment, but the company is taking a proactive approach towards making sure they can cross one potential problem off of the list. Reports indicate that the electric vehicle maker is about to shore up battery production in a big way. more
CNET has the news on the steps that Tesla is taking.
Tesla is allegedly pulling out all the stops in an effort to remove every possible roadblock that could stymie Model 3 production.
Tesla has flown six planes’ worth of battery production equipment from Europe in order to bolster efforts at its Gigafactory plant in Nevada, Reuters reports, citing people familiar with the matter. CEO Elon Musk has claimed in the past that improvements in battery production will provide a solid boost to the Model 3’s production efforts.
Reuters notes that sources claim that “money seems to be no obstacle” in terms of making sure this initiative goes off without a hitch. While it’s admirable that the company is going out of its way to be proactive when it comes to battery production, there’s a rather large elephant in the room when it comes to dropping a ton of cash to make it happen.
There have been a number of concerns raised over Tesla’s cash burn rate as it is, and pricey transport costs aren’t going to help that situation. That said, perhaps it’ll all balance out in the end if the company can insure that Model 3 production isn’t impacted in the future.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.31 (-0.46%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -9.71%, versus a 1.73% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-29,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Pays Out Autopilot Lawsuit Claims,3,278.85,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-pays-out-autopilot-lawsuit-claims/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been facing a class action suit for problems related to its Autopilot feature, and the company has taken a big step towards putting the issue in the rear view mirror. The electric vehicle maker is prepared to pony up and pay in a bid to satisfy aggrieved customers.  more
Techcrunch has the details on Tesla’s decision.
Tesla has paid out $5 million to settle a 2017 class action lawsuit that originally alleged that the Autopilot feature shipped in 2016 in the company’s cars was “essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.” The settlement does not admit this, but rather compensates owners for delays in delivering the promised functionality; owners who paid $5,000 for Autopilot will be reimbursed for as little as $20 or as much as $280 according to how long they had to wait.
Although Tesla claimed that the semi-autonomous driving software would improve safety and reduce the possibility of collisions, it was in practice erratic and unreliable. “Contrary to what Tesla represented to them, buyers of affected vehicles have become beta testers of half-baked software that renders Tesla vehicles dangerous if engaged,” read the initial complaint.
“We want to do right by those customers, so as part of a proposed settlement agreement for a class action lawsuit filed last year, we’ve agreed to compensate customers who purchased Autopilot on Hardware 2 vehicles who had to wait longer than we expected for these features,” a statement fro Tesla reads in part. The company has decided to pay up to put the matter to rest, and it has even decided to take the step of kicking things up a notch for other affected consumers.
“Although the settlement is specific to customers in the US, if it is approved by the court, we’ve decided to compensate all customers globally in the same way. There’s no legal obligation to do so, but it’s the right thing to do,” the statement continued.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $283.76 per share on Tuesday morning, up $4.91 (+1.76%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -8.86%, versus a 1.77% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to have trouble producing its Model 3 sedan in large numbers, and a big part of the problem is a lack of batteries.more
To address this issue, as Reuters reports, the company is apparently going to extreme measures:
Tesla Inc has flown six planes full of robots and equipment from Europe to California in an unusual, high-stakes effort to speed up battery production for its Model 3 electric sedan, people familiar with the matter told Reuters this week.
Transporting equipment for a production line by air is costly and hardly ever done in the automotive industry, and the move underscores Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk’s urgency to get a grip on manufacturing problems that have hobbled the launch of the high-volume Model 3 and pushed Tesla’s finances deep into the red.
Model 3 production has repeatedly missed the company’s own estimates, and investors are beginning to wonder if the automaker can ever live up to its lofty goals of escaping the niche market to become a major player in the industry. CEO Elon Musk has promised that Tesla would stop burning cash in the third quarter of this year, but that seems highly unlikely at this juncture.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $278.85 on Friday, up $1.00 (+0.36%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -10.44%, versus a 2.39% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Baird still anticipates a substantial rally from the carmaker, and the firm has reiterated its rating to get that point across. more
CNBC shares the firm’s take on Tesla.
The deluge of recent negative media coverage on Tesla is missing the real story, according to one Wall Street firm.
Baird reiterated its outperform rating for Tesla shares, predicting the electric car maker will make significant progress in raising its Model 3 production volumes.
“We think we have hit a peak in negative coverage/sentiment, and believe shares could appreciate significantly with execution, which should coincide with an improvement in sentiment,” shared analyst Ben Kallo said in a note to clients.
He’s sticking by his $411 price target for Tesla as well. Interestingly, CEO Elon Musk hopped on Twitter to share some sentiments about media coverage of his company. “The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them,” he shared.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $279.07 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $4.06 (+1.48%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -10.37%, versus a 2.85% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-23,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Quickly Takes Advantage of China Tariff Cuts,4,275.01,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-quickly-takes-advantage-of-china-tariff-cuts/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is among the carmakers that will benefit substantially from China’s decision to slash tariffs, and the company has decided what it’s going to do with at least some of the savings. Prices are going to be coming down, and that could lead to the electric vehicle maker gaining even more traction in the massive market.  more
Reuters has the details on Tesla’s price cut.
Tesla Inc has slashed up to $14,000 off its Model X in China after Beijing announced major tariff cuts for imported automobiles, a potential sales boost for the U.S. firm as the world’s largest auto market pivots towards electric cars.
The carmaker will lower prices of its Model S and Model X cars by just over 6 percent, a Beijing-based sales representative told Reuters on Wednesday.
While that’s a substantial savings for consumers, a top-of-the range Model X will still set customers back 1.3 million yuan ($203,830). For comparison sake, the priciest Model X in the United States checks in with a price tag of  $140,000.
Automotive Foresight’s Yale Zhang predicts that “imminent price adjustments in the higher-end segment, that will over time lead to a pricing adjustment for the entire market.”
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.93 (-0.70%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -11.67%, versus a 2.56% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-22,Consumer Reports to Test Tesla Inc's (TSLA) Model 3 Again,3,284.49,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-consumer-reports-to-test-tesla-incs-tsla-model-3-again/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) received a less than flattering review from Consumer Reports for its Model 3 sedan, but it looks like the company is going to get a rare do-over. The publication says it’ll be happy to conduct a re-test if the company fixes the issues as promised. more
Reuters passes along a positive piece of news for Tesla.
Consumer Reports said Tuesday it will retest brakes on Tesla Inc’s new Model 3 sedans after Chief Executive Elon Musk promised a software update, but the potential hit to sales from the magazine’s negative review weighed on Tesla stock.
A review by the influential magazine on Monday said the car, despite many positives, had “big flaws,” including braking slower than a full-sized pickup truck. That criticism adds to headaches for Musk, already facing pressure over a series of crashes, production issues, and the company’s finances.
After the CR review made headlines, CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to explain that the issues could be fixed. “Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update,” he shared. “With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs.” He indicated that it will be fixed ASAP, and encouraged CR to test an updated model.
Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports’ director of automotive testing, noted that “if Tesla can update the brakes over the air – an industry first – we’d be happy to retest our Model 3.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $275.32 per share on Tuesday afternoon, down $9.17 (-3.22%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -11.57%, versus a 2.81% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-22,Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk Says Fix to Address Consumer Reports Concerns is Coming,3,284.49,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-ceo-elon-musk-said-a-problem-with-the-model-3/,"
The hits keep on coming for Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 sedan – and we’re not even talking about production troubles this time around. Consumer Reports dropped a less than flattering review on the car that indicates a potential braking issue, but CEO Elon Musk insists the problem will be promptly addressed. more
Reuters has the details on Tesla’s latest troubles and response.
Tesla Inc’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk admitted late on Monday there was a braking issue with the Model 3 sedan, pointed out by Consumer Reports, and said it can be fixed with a firmware update that the electric car maker will be rolling out in a few days.
“With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car,” Musk wrote in a tweet.
The influential publication notes that it simply can’t recommend the Model 3. While it heaped praise on certain features, Consumer Reports walked away concerned that the car braked slower than a full-sized pickup truck during its testing. Musk also indicated that the tests were run on an early production model, and that he was going to request that CR take a newer model and give it the same once-over.
“Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements,” Musk added.

2018-05-21,Tesla Inc's (TSLA) Model 3 Falls Short in Latest Consumer Reports’ Review,4,276.82,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-consumer-reports-says-model-3-falls-short-of-a-cr/,"
Expectations are high when it comes to Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3, but it can be tough to get a straight answer on what exactly to expect due to the various production troubles and other happenings at the company. However, we now have a take from one respected name that consumers turn to, and the results are a mixed bag for the electric vehicle maker.   more
Consumer Reports shares it’s assessment of the highly-anticipated Tesla vehicle.
Tesla’s Model 3 represents the electric automaker’s first attempt at a more affordable mass-market car. In Consumer Reports’ tests, we found plenty to like about the luxury compact sedan (which starts at $35,000 but goes all the way up to $78,000), including record-setting range as well as exhilarating acceleration and handling that could make it a healthy competitor to performance-oriented cars such as BMW’s 3 Series and the Audi A4. Our testers also found flaws—big flaws—such as long stopping distances in our emergency braking test and difficult-to-use controls.
These problems keep the Model 3 from earning a Consumer Reports recommendation.
In the braking test, Consumer Reports found that Tesla’s “stopping distance of 152 feet from 60 mph was far worse than any contemporary car we’ve tested.” A Tesla spokesperson disagreed with the findings and noted that they came up with 133 feet. The spokesperson also pointed out the different variables that can affect results. Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at CR, explains that the publication followed the same procedures it has always followed in vehicle tests.
“Before each test, we make sure the brake pads and tires have been properly conditioned,” Fisher explained. “We’ve conducted it on more than 500 vehicles, and we are always looking for consistent, repeatable results.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $282.05 per share on Monday afternoon, up $5.23 (+1.89%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -9.41%, versus a 2.77% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is going to shock the world with how profitable its Model 3 will be. That’s the general take from one Wall Street firm that has come forward with a very bullish price target for the electric vehicle maker.  more
CNBC shares the firm’s prediction for Tesla share prices.
The hand-wringing over Tesla’s ability to generate profits on the Model 3 is overblown, according to Berenberg.
The firm raised its price target for Tesla, predicting the electric car maker will be able to meet its 25 percent gross profit margin forecast for the Model 3. Berenberg also reiterated its buy rating for the stock.
Berenberg analyst Alexander Haissl has boosted his price target for Tesla from the already lofty $470 to $500. He explained the reason for his optimism in a note to clients.
“Model 3 gross margin to positively surprise. The widespread assumption that Model 3 margins can be directly inferred from Model S/X is inherently and almost totally flawed,” he wrote. “Substantial gains from lower labour content, as well as capital and material use efficiencies, should allow Tesla to comfortably achieve a margin above 25% throughout the product cycle.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $285.26 per share on Monday morning, up $8.44 (+3.05%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -8.38%, versus a 2.96% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) bonds have attracted the interest of billionaire investor George Soros. His investment firm scooped up $35 million worth of the bonds in the first quarter of 2018.   more
CNBC has the news on Tesla’s new backer.
George Soros’ investment firm bought a large amount of Tesla bonds in the first quarter of 2018, giving the under pressure electric carmaker a major backer, a regulatory filing shows.
Soros Fund Management bought $35 million worth of convertible notes, which are bonds that can be converted into a specified number of common stock, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing released on Tuesday. The convertible bond is due in March 2019.
In general, Tesla has leaned pretty heavily on the debt markets to raise capital, and there has been speculation that the company will need to go that route again soon. It has been a challenging start to the year for the electric carmaker, and share prices have been volatile as a result.
There seems to be a pretty mixed sentiment about the company as a whole. On the one hand, we have Tesla devotees that continually proclaim that all is well regardless of what the headlines may say. On the other hand, a number of Tesla critics view the plethora of red flags as a clear sign of a sinking ship.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is going to need to raise a ton of cash to make it through to 2020, according to Goldman Sachs. The investment banking giant is holding firm on its sell rating for Tesla, as it expects the carmaker to continue struggling to reach its goals.  more
Marketwatch shares Goldman’s thoughts on Tesla.
Tesla Inc. will need about $10.5 billion in fresh capital through 2020 to keep operating and meet its own targets, Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday.
That’s the sum needed from external capital raises and debt refinancing for the electric-car maker to fund its current operations and finance new product spend and capacity additions, Goldman analysts led by David Tamberrino wrote in a Thursday note. Goldman is assuming that Tesla TSLA, -0.20% will go ahead with a plan to launch a new vehicle manufacturing plant and gigafactory in China.
Tesla has been besieged with negative headlines in recent times, and there have been plenty of rumblings that the company will be hitting the capital markets before too long. Goldman doesn’t anticipate Tesla having any trouble raising the capital, but the firm is not all that optimistic that temporarily improving cash flow will serve as a magic bullet.
“We see several options available to the company to refinance maturing debt and raise incremental funds, which should allow Tesla to fund its growth targets,” the analyst wrote. “Our preference is to express long views via the front-end convertible credit — and we continue to express a bearish view on the equity,”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $286.41 per share on Thursday afternoon, down $0.07 (-0.02%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -8.01%, versus a 2.44% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has raised plenty of eyebrows with its decision to halt production of the Model 3 for six days in order to work out some kinks, but one observer thinks it’s a capital idea. Tech analyst Gene Munster is on board with the company’s decision and gave it a thumbs up during a recent appearance on CNBC. more
CNBC shares Munster’s take on Tesla’s decision.
Tesla’s move to shut down production of its Model 3 for six days is a “big deal” but it’s not necessarily a bad thing, tech analyst-turned-venture capitalist Gene Munster told CNBC on Tuesday.
The electric car maker plans to pause production at its California factory at the end of May to work on fixes to its assembly line, sources inside the company told Reuters.
“This manufacturing shutdown is evidence that things are moving in a good direction,” said Munster. Tesla has been plagued with production problems, so perhaps the shutdown will prove to be the elixir that’s needed to ultimately boost productivity. As for the rash of executive departures from the carmaker in recent times, Munster is also less than concerned.
“I’m comfortable that they are moving things in a good direction,” he added.
Tesla Inc shares were unchanged in after-hours trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -7.99%, versus a 2.42% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) took a hit on Tuesday, and there could be more pain to come if prices hit a critical level. That’s the take from one equity strategist that has outlined what he sees as a “line in the sand” for Tesla investors. more
CNBC passes along the strategists’ take on Tesla share prices.
While a few key levels are holding the stock together, any more pain might push investors to their breaking point, according to one market watcher.
“It has two key support levels that we’re watching,” Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “First was the $285 level. That had been the double-top high from 2014 and 2015 and once it got above that, that became new support.”
There has been a good amount of volatility in Tesla shares over recent weeks. A number of negative headlines hasn’t helped matters, and there’s a general sense of leeriness surrounding the stock at the moment. For Maley, there’s danger ahead if a key support level is breached.
“Now that we’re breaking below that, that’s creating some problems, so we got to watch out. It could be a quick move back down to its $250 level. That was the low back in March,” he said. “That’s the kind of line in the sand — investors are going to get really concerned. A lot of the momentum money is going to leave the stock if you break below that level.”
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.18 (-0.42%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -9.30%, versus a 1.78% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Negative news and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) seem to be going hand-in-hand in recent times, but the company still has plenty of loyalists and fans that are expecting big things from the carmaker in the future. We can count one less analyst on that list, and that analyst was formerly a pretty big cheerleader for the company.  more
Zero Hedge has the details on the analyst that’s changing his tune on Tesla.
In a world in which Elon Musk found himself with increasingly fewer friends, one thing was certain: Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, always eager for that lead left spot in the next Tesla convertible, would stick with Tesla and Musk through thick and thin, no matter what.
Well, that ended this morning when Jonas appears to have had enough, slashing his price target on the car maker from $376 to $291, stating that following 1Q18 results, he is making significant cuts to his near-term and long-term auto margin forecasts, while forecasting greater equity dilution, i.e. another stock offering. Jonas now sees “Tesla as trading near fair value with a balanced risk-reward.”
Among Tesla’s recent negative headlines have been concerns over production goals, inquiries about vehicle safety in the wake of a pair of high-profile crashes, fears over the company’s cash burn rate, and an unusual earnings call with CEO Elon Musk. Jonas is among those that’s a bit concerned with the plethora of red flags, and he’s lowering his price target as a result.
“We believe there is significant potential strategic value within Tesla, including its invested capital, design, brand, technology, relationships with key stakeholders (suppliers, governments, commercial partners) and its people,” Jonas added.

2018-05-14,Report: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Battling Management For Additional Safety Sensors,3,291.97,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-report-tesla-inc-tsla-battling-management-for-additional-safety-sensors/,"
Among the many reasons that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been in the spotlight of late is concerns over its Autopilot feature. A pair of recent high-profile crashes while the feature was engaged have brought additional scrutiny on the carmaker, and a new report paints a less than flattering portrayal of the company’s decision-making process.  more
CNBC has the details on an apparent disagreement between Tesla management and its engineers.
Tesla engineers repeatedly argued in favor of adding more sensors to the carmaker’s vehicles, but top executives, including CEO Elon Musk, rejected the idea, saying the devices were ineffective or would annoy drivers too much, says a new report from The Wall Street Journal.
Engineers wanted to add sensors to the company’s Autopilot system that would have alerted drivers when they took their eyes off the road or took their hands off the wheel, but senior executives, including Musk, concluded they weren’t necessary.
The recent crashes – one in Florida and one in California – proved to be fatal, and they occurred while the Autopilot system was engaged. While there’s no guarantee that additional sensors would have prevented the tragedies, the report is still another body blow for a company that has been dealing with more than its share of them of late.
A Tesla spokesperson explained to the WSJ that the company “explored many technologies and opted for the combination of a hands-on-wheel torsion sensor with visual and audio alerts, and we will of course continue to evaluate new technologies as we evolve the Tesla fleet over time.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $291.97 per share on Monday afternoon, down $9.09 (-3.02%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -6.22%, versus a 2.69% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been in the headlines an awful lot of late, and it’s often for the wrong reasons. However, the company continues to have plenty of loyalists, including one billionaire investor that believes he’s in line to make even more cash as a result of his investment in the company. more
CNBC passes along the investor’s take on Tesla.
Buy and hold billionaire Ron Baron is defending his investment in Tesla, saying he doesn’t care that he hasn’t made much money from the electric car maker yet.
“I think we’re going to make 20 times our money because the opportunity is so enormous,” the 75-year-old founder of Baron Capital told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday. “People say, ‘Gee, they’re spending a lot of cash.’ Of course, they’re spending a lot of cash. They’re building factories.”
Among the negative headlines surrounding Tesla of late have been concerns about production goals, the company’s cash flow, and the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. Baron, whose firms stake in Tesla amounts to 1.62 percent of its total assets under management, is undeterred by the red flags.
During his appearance, Baron said that “you have to expect when you’re doing something entirely different than what anyone has done before” that not everything is going to go along swimmingly.

2018-05-14,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Maneuvers For Upcoming China Rule Change,3,301.06,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-maneuvers-for-upcoming-china-rule-change/,"
From concerns about cash flow and debt load to questions about production goals and delivering on expectations, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has more than enough items on its plate at the moment. The carmaker’s full plate is not just limited to our shores either, as evidenced by this proactive move the company was forced to take in China.   more
Reuters has the details Tesla’s move.
Tesla Inc has registered a new electric car firm in Shanghai, as China prepares to scrap rules on capping foreign ownership of new-energy vehicle (NEV) ventures.
The new company, Tesla (Shanghai) Co Ltd, was registered on May 10, according to a filing with the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System seen by Reuters.
According to the filing, the new company will be focused on batteries, electric cars, and spare parts. Tesla has reportedly been going back and forth with officials in Shanghai to set up its own plant in the region, but it’s unclear if the new firm is somehow related to those talks.
When approached for comment by Reuters, a Tesla spokeswoman noted that the company doesn’t “have anything new to add on this registration for now.”
Tesla Inc shares rose $3.04 (+1.01%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.30%, versus a 2.65% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #10 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.

2018-05-11,Activist Investor Looks To Unseat Three Tesla Inc (TSLA) Board Members,3,305.02,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-activist-investor-looks-to-unseat-three-tesla-inc-tsla-board/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) needs some fresh eyes and minds in its board of directors, if it’s going to reach its lofty electric vehicle and energy goals.more
That’s according to one activist investor group, which is pushing to oust some Tesla board members soon. MarketWatch has more details:
An activist investor is urging Tesla Inc. shareholders to unseat three members of the company’s board of directors, saying they lack independence, knowledge, and a track record in corporate governance, in the first fallout from last week’s erratic post-results conference call.
CtW Investment Group, which is tied to union pension funds, is lobbying for a “no” vote at the company’s shareholder meeting on the reelection of Antonio Gracias (a VC guy), Kimbal Musk (Elon Musk’s brother), and James Murdoch (CEO of 21st Century Fox).
“We admire Tesla as successful innovator with an environmental mission; however, its continuing success looks more tenuous than ever,” CtW said in a regulatory filing. The group claims that Gracias and Kimbal Musk share “multiple” ties with Tesla’s CEO, which prevents them from being impartial board members. Meanwhile, CtW believes Murdoch and Kimbal Musk both lack “relevant industry experience.”
“Tesla shareholders need to let the board know that it must raise its game and begin the long-overdue process of renewing its membership and processes by adding currently missing industry, governance, and human capital management expertise,” the group concluded.
Tesla Inc shares fell $0.02 (-0.01%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.03%, versus a 2.34% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-10,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Teases Another Vehicle Model,3,305.02,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-teases-another-vehicle-model/,"
While Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) seems to have more than enough balloons in the air at the moment, there could be another one added to the party before too long. A new video has been making the rounds on You Tube that suggests yet another Tesla model is in the works. more
CNBC shares the buzz on Tesla.
A new video Tesla posted to YouTube shows an image of an unnamed vehicle partially hidden by a sheet, and footage of passengers reacting to the acceleration of Tesla’s planned second-generation Roadster.
The video, posted Wednesday, first pointed out by electric vehicle blog Electrek, is a stab at generating hype around Tesla’s brand days after CEO Elon Musk behaved antagonistically toward Wall Street analysts during the company’s first-quarter earnings conference call.
While it’s unclear from the video what may be behind the sheet, many observers are speculating that it could simply be the planed Model Y. That model is a crossover that’s based on the Model 3, and Musk indicated that progress has been made on it during the contentious call.
“There’s no question we could have made the Model 3 much easier to produce than we have,” he said. “I think Model Y is going to be a manufacturing revolution.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $305.02 per share on Thursday afternoon, down $1.83 (-0.60%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.03%, versus a 2.34% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been slapped around with a gaggle of bad headlines in recent times, but there could be some good news on the horizon. The state of California is set to vote on a plan that could lead to a boon for Tesla solar sales in the future.  more
CNBC has the details on what could be good news for Tesla.
California is poised to become the first state in the nation to mandate solar panels on most new homes as part of a program to harness clean technology and reduce the impact of new homes on the environment.
The California Energy Commission is expected to vote on the plan Wednesday. If approved by the five-member board, it would become effective Jan. 1, 2020, on most single-family homes as well as multi-family residential buildings of three stories or less, including condos and apartment complexes.
Sean Gallagher, VP state affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, is among those that’s on board with the plan. He explained that the state is already a leader in the adoption of solar, so it’s a natural evolution for it to continue leading the way.
“California is taking a step further basically recognizing that solar should be as commonplace as a front door welcoming you home,” he said.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $304.50 per share on Wednesday morning, up $2.53 (+0.84%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.20%, versus a 0.76% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-08,New Accounting Rules Work To Tesla Inc's (TSLA) Benefit,3,302.77,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-new-accounting-rules-work-to-tesla-incs-tsla-benefit/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was able to deliver Q1 revenues that were better than analysts expectations, but the automaker may not have been able to do so without recent changes to accounting rules. On January 1, new revenue recognition rules went into effect, and that gave Tesla’s numbers a lift.  more
Marketwatch has the details on how the changes affected Tesla.
A new accounting rule helped electric car maker Tesla Inc. to post a first-quarter revenue beat, and the company also used the change to book a stealth adjustment to its running total of accumulated losses.
Tesla reported revenues of $3.4 billion compared with analyst expectations of revenues of $3.2 billion, up from $2.7 billion a year ago.
In short, the rules impact the way the company accounts for vehicle sales. Certain transactions can now be recorded directly as sales as opposed to operating leases as they were before, and that leads to an acceleration of how revenue gets reported by the company.
To be clear, Tesla is following the rules when it comes to accounting, but its loss for the quarter would likely have been far worse absent the recent changes.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $306.70 per share on Tuesday morning, up $3.93 (+1.30%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -1.49%, versus a 0.17% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-08,Analyst: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Bonds Paint Murky Picture,3,302.77,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-analyst-tesla-inc-tsla-bonds-paint-murky-picture/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been going through a ton of cash and that’s likely to continue, according to analysts from CreditSights. The firm believes that Tesla’s burn rate could even double in the coming months. more
Marketwatch shares the analysts’ take on Tesla.
Tesla Inc.’s “cash bleed” will likely double in the second quarter as the Silicon Valley car maker attempts to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan, analysts at CreditSights said Monday.
Liquidity at Tesla TSLA, -0.63% will remain “tight” before its cash situation improves in the second half of the year, said the analysts, who analyze company debt. Tesla is banking on a steady production rate for the Model 3 and product turnover in the second half to rebuild its cash balance, they said.
As a result, analysts Hitin Anand and Brendan Keevan are pointing out that the risk-reward rate on Tesla bonds are “still not attractive.” They have the equivalent of a sell rating in place for the bonds, and they also expect the company will be looking for funding again before too long.
“Further capital raise for Model 3 possibly can be avoided, but Tesla will most certainly need debt/equity funding for future growth projects,” the analysts wrote.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.77 (-0.58%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.76%, versus a 0.42% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-08,Musk Takes Fight To Short Sellers With Big Tesla Inc (TSLA) Inside Purchase,3,302.77,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-musk-takes-fight-to-short-sellers-with-big-tesla-inc/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has more than its fair share of doubters on Wall Street.more
The electric automaker remains one of the most heavily shorted stocks on earth, despite its strong performance over the past several years.
Now, as MarketWatch reports, the company’s enigmatic CEO, Elon Musk, is taking the fight directly to the short sellers that are betting on a big decline:
The chief executive officer of the electric auto maker TSLA bought about $9.85 million worth of Tesla shares, his biggest purchase since March 2017, according to a regulatory filing.
Musk has now grown his stake to near 20%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Musk last week promised to “burn” those betting against the company, which hasn’t earned a yearly profit in its 15-year history and who analysts believe will continue to “bleed cash.”
Musk’s move comes amid what many consider to be erratic behavior in a recent earnings call. The executive went completely off script during the call last week, insulting analysts, the media, federal regulators, and even drivers of his cars that had died behind the wheel, allegedly as a result of their own negligence.
He also warned anyone worried about volatility to not invest in his company, which is probably very good advice.
Tesla Inc shares fell $2.52 (-0.83%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.76%, versus a 0.42% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-07,Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk Disagrees With Warren Buffett,3,294.09,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-ceo-elon-musk-disagrees-with-warren-buffett/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has been in the headlines quite often in recent times. From concerns about the company’s financial health to last week’s bizarre earnings call, Musk has certainly got people talking. He’s managed to do it again, and this time it was for some words of wisdom he had for Warren Buffett.    more
CNBC has the details on another way the Tesla CEO sees things differently.
Warren Buffett disagrees with Elon Musk’s assessment of one of his main investing tenets.
Buffett has long advised investors to look for companies that have a “moat,” or enough of a buffer around them to maintain a competitive advantage over industry peers in terms of brand strength and business model.
Buffett’s advice about companies with a strong moat has become a part of investing lore, but it doesn’t appear that Musk puts a whole lot of stock into that. As Musk sees it, “moats are lame.” From his perspective, “what matters is the pace of innovation.” Musk dropped those little gems on social media, but Buffett has resisted any urge he may have felt to share additional wisdom with the Tesla CEO.
“There are some pretty good moats around. Being the low cost producer for example is a terribly important moat,” Buffett said at this weekend’s Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting.
Tesla Inc shares rose $2.91 (+0.99%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.73%, versus a 0.39% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-07,Here's How A Tesla Inc (TSLA) Bankruptcy Could Unfold,3,294.09,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-heres-how-a-tesla-inc-tsla-bankruptcy-could-unfold/,"
A number of concerns about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) have come to light for investors in recent times, and that’s led to plenty of speculation about how things are ultimately going to turn out for the company. Unfortunately, auto industry history suggests the company is playing a very dangerous game with its balance sheet.  more
Business Insider shares some insight into how the unthinkable could come to pass for Tesla.
It’s important to remember that like Tesla, GM and Chrysler were saddled with debt and failing to make money prior to the financial crisis. But nobody was seriously predicting Chapter 11 — until both carmakers had their access to debt funding cut off. Then bankruptcy arrived like a raptor swooping down on its prey.
Tesla is playing chicken with its balance sheet and has gotten away with it while the economy has been bubbly. In the car business, that works until suddenly it doesn’t.
Former General Motors vice chair Bob Lutz saw GM go bankrupt back in 2009, and he noted during a recent appearance on CNBC that he sees some troubling signs with Tesla’s appetite for dipping into the capital markets for funding. “That may work one more time, and then he’s going to run out of money again, and then he’s cooked,” he explained. “At this rate, Chapter 11 [bankruptcy] is a certainty.”
When you add in the unusual earnings call with CEO Elon Musk from last week, it’s pretty easy to see why investors and observers are a little worried about Tesla. That said, we’ll have to patiently wait and see how this all ultimately plays out.
Tesla Inc shares fell $0.79 (-0.27%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.54%, versus a 0.08% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

On yesterday’s rather interesting Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings call, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company still has another iron in the fire that hasn’t been getting all that much attention. Tesla still has its sights set on some form of a ridesharing network, but details on what that means remain unclear.  more
Techcrunch has the details on another item on Tesla’s lengthy to-do list.
On Tesla’s Q1 2018 earnings call today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk shed some light on the company’s ambitions to launch an autonomous-vehicle ridesharing network. The short answer is that, from a technical standpoint, Tesla will be ready by the end of next year, Musk said. It’s not yet clear, however, when Tesla would actually launch the network.
The longer answer involves discussion about regulation and the need to have full autonomy in place. That is, Level 4 or Level 5 autonomy that doesn’t require human intervention.
As Musk sees it, the future points to “where you can own your car and have 100 percent usage of your car,” meaning that it’ll be possible for users to essentially share their cars when they’re not using them for their own purposes. Whether that means some kind of Uber or Lyft model – or perhaps an Airbnb for cars, if you will – is not crystal clear, but Musk indicates that his vision is a no-brainer.
“This is the obvious thing that’s going to happen,” he said.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $284.69 per share on Thursday afternoon, down $16.46 (-5.47%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -8.56%, versus a -1.18% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

If you haven’t heard the buzz by now, Tesla CEO Elon Musk grew frustrated with analyst questions during yesterday’s post-earnings call and responded a bit oddly. The story grew quickly. Before you know it, investors started to make a move toward the exits. The stock is down nearly $19 in the pre-market. The one key question about whether the company will be doing a capital raise was the breaking point. Wall Street would not be surprised if the company had to come back to the market once again, but Mr. Musk wasn’t having that conversation. The company has been rocked with numerous executive departures at the top, so the focus on the CEO’s behavior during the call has made some folks nervous as to the current environment. We all know talented folks who can sometimes be their own worst enemy. My guess is Mr. Musk could fall under that category.more

Investing in Your Lane, But Not Always
You may have heard the expression “stay in your lane” when it comes to the work you know how to do, or sticking to the skills you possess in order to leverage them and not go off on a tangent. Investing can be said to be similar in nature. However, the issue arises when the investing lane you know isn’t working so well. When that happens, you have to force yourself to adapt to what is working. For many, the challenge can be insurmountable, but if surviving for the long run is your goal, you have to adapt. Some of my Italian relatives are “old school” when it come to where they want to keep their money. The bank and CDs in particular have always been their “peace of mind” strategy for investing. They have had various periods of time where this has worked out for them, but there have also unfortunately been plenty of periods where it hasn’t. Think post-2009 to current day and the example couldn’t be more glaring. Keeping money in bank CDs would have been brutal the last 9 years or so. We all know inflation doesn’t stop, so when you string together a bunch of years that underperform as Bank CDs have in terms of yield, it’s hard to make that back up. So you have to evolve as an investor and embrace new opportunities that are still considered fairly safe (stocks, bonds). If you don’t, the nest egg you may have accumulated will continue to lose buying power more and more when inflation eats away at it.
Tomorrow is More Important Than Yesterday (On Wall Street and In The Real World)
Stopping to smell the roses is a phrase we are reminded of when we are working real hard and the pleasure of doing big things appears to be lost. Happens to more people than you think. Celebrities long for days they can just walk down the street and no one is stopping them for a picture or autograph. Athletes go through it as well, and it can be even harder for them when they aren’t performing well in whatever sport they are in. However, if you can accept the fact that your wins will be nice to reflect on over time, you will escape the fixation with being too focused on what happened previously. We all have good days in our workplace or business, and then some days we simply wished we didn’t get out of bed. On Wall Street, analysts are always looking ahead to future earnings and adjusting stock prices based on what those expectations are. We ourselves would perform and look at things much different if we did the same. We would also not get hung up on the tough days.

2018-05-03,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Is Making -- And Losing -- More Money Than Ever,4,301.15,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-is-making-and-losing-more/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is either performing like gangbusters or in a deep financial hole, depending on how you look at it.more
The electric vehicle maker reported better-than-expected first quarter earnings results late Wednesday, with revenue rising to record levels. However, its net losses also climbed higher than ever, to ($784.6 million). Its cash position has suffered as a result, and is now down to $2.7 billion — enough to cover only three and a half quarters of operations, if the trend continues.
However, as TechCrunch reports, the company attempted to paint a rosy picture based on strong production gains for its all-important affordable EV sedan:
In its letter to investors, Tesla provided some updates to its Model 3 production, noting it hit 2,270 cars produced per week for three straight weeks in April.
“Even at this stage of the ramp, Model 3 is already on the cusp of becoming the best-selling mid-sized premium sedan in the US, and our deliveries continue to increase,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk and CFO Deepak Ahuja wrote in a letter to investors. “Consumers have clearly shown that electric vehicles are simply more desirable when priced on par with their internal combustion engine competitors while offering better technology, performance and user experience.”
Still, investors sold the stock off hard after the report. They’re no doubt worried the company will have to raise more cash very soon, and the cost of doing so will be much higher this time around.
Tesla Inc shares fell $10.87 (-3.61%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.28%, versus a -0.98% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-02,German Automakers Are Gunning For Tesla Inc (TSLA),3,299.92,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-german-automakers-are-gunning-for-tesla-inc-tsla/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may get all of the headlines when it comes to the electric vehicle market, but that doesn’t mean that it’s the only company bringing anything to the table on that front. In fact, a number of automakers are set to debut their own offerings, and some observers believe that should make Tesla awfully nervous.   more
Bloomberg has some insight on the challengers that will be taking aim at Tesla.
Elon Musk started Tesla Inc. with a goal of accelerating the switch to electric cars by about a decade.
That wish is now catching up with him. Starting with Jaguar’s I-Pace crossover and later this year Audi’s Q6 e-tron, virtually every major carmaker is rolling out stylish, sporty electric vehicles in the mold of his Models S, X and 3. Unlike Tesla, they have roughly a century of experience launching models every few months and can spread development costs across a broad portfolio.
Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, has gotten a look at what some of the other companies have up their sleeves, and we can color him impressed. “The vehicles I’ve seen are far superior to anything Tesla has,” he said.  “They are in a massive pivot and shift away from diesel investment into electrification in both pure electric and plug-in hybrid.”
That’s not welcome news for a company that is having serious problems realizing its production goals, but we will have to wait and see how things ultimately pan out in the growing electric vehicle market.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $302.43 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $2.51 (+0.84%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.86%, versus a -0.77% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-02,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Slapped With $2B Suit For Alleged Patent Design Theft Of Semi Trucks,3,299.92,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-slapped-with-2b-for-alleged-patent-design/,"
We can add another issue to the lengthy list that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to work its way through. This one has to do with allegations of patent infringement, as the company has just been slapped with a suit alleging it ripped off the design for a much-heralded project that it has in the pipeline. more
Marketwatch has the details on the suit that’s been filed against Tesla.
Tesla Inc. is being sued for more than $2 billion by electric-hydrogen truck startup Nikola Motor Co., which is claiming its patents were infringed.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Arizona, Nikola claims Tesla TSLA, -0.22% copied the design of its big rigs, which Nikola first unveiled in May 2016.
Nikola says that it sent a cease-and-desist letter pointing out the striking similarities between its design and the one that Tesla planned to unveil, and the company requested that Tesla hold off on its public unveiling. Tesla did not respond, and it also went ahead with a heavily-publicized event to tour the electric semi.
Nikola contends that Tesla’s unveiling has led to “confusion in the market,” and the company is seeking damages that are roughly equivalent to the jump in Tesla’s market cap following the debut of the semi. A Tesla spokesperson dismissed the significance of the claim, noting that it’s “patently obvious there is no merit to this lawsuit.”
Tesla Inc shares fell $2.92 (-0.97%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.67%, versus a -0.31% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-05-01,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Moving Away From Solar Leasing Finance Deals,3,293.90,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-moving-away-from-solar-leasing-finance-deals/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) acquired SolarCity back in 2016, and the natural expectation was that some changes would be coming to the residential solar industry as a result. Those expectations have been realized, but not necessarily in the way that some observers were expecting.  more
Bloomberg has the details on a Tesla-inspired change to the residential solar market.
U.S. residential solar surged this decade on the back of leasing deals that helped consumers get rooftop power systems with no money down. The financing arrangement accounted for the majority of the market after 2011 until being surpassed by cash sales and loans last year, according to a report Tuesday by GTM Research.
There are several explanations for the shift, notably the widespread availability of loans. The main factor: Tesla Inc. is pivoting away from leasing, according to Allison Mond, a GTM analyst.
For 2017, loans and cash sales accounted for 59 percent of residential solar deals, with leases and power-purchase agreements accounting for the remainder. As Mond explained to Bloomberg, there’s a clear cut reason why the trend in the industry has shifted.
“The single biggest driver of the quick emergence of customer ownership in 2018 is the contraction of SolarCity/Tesla as an installer,” she said via email.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $295.60 per share on Tuesday morning, up $1.70 (+0.58%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.06%, versus a -0.79% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-30,Model 3 Production Huge Focus For Tesla Inc (TSLA) Earnings Report,4,294.08,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-model-3-production-huge-focus-for-tesla-inc-tsla-earnings/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been dealing with a slew of negative headlines in recent weeks, but they will all become moot points if the company is able to deliver the goods when it reports earnings on Wednesday. However, that whole scenario could be flipped upside down if additional troubling signs emerge from the report on the production front.  more
Marketwatch has the details on the situation that Tesla is facing.
Model 3 production updates are bound to dominate the subsequent conference call with investors, as they have been since the first Model 3s rolled off the assembly line in July.
And it is no wonder: The mass-market sedan, which starts around $35,000, is viewed as the engine of Tesla’s lofty ambitions, which include adding more passenger vehicles to its lineup, filling the preorders of its all-electric heavy-duty truck, and selling its solar roof tiles.
Analysts are expecting an adjusted loss of somewhere in the neighborhood of $3.20 to $3.54 per share. Those expectations seem to be baked into the cake that is the company’s stock price, but additional bad news on the production front may not be.
CEO Elon Musk has been doing his best to convince investors that any and all kinks are being ironed out, but that hasn’t resulted in the company’s production targets being realized as of yet. We should see some additional signs on Wednesday, and the market will react accordingly.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $297.33 per share on Monday morning, up $3.26 (+1.11%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.50%, versus a 0.70% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-30,Some Tesla Inc (TSLA) Shareholders Want CEO Elon Musk Removed From Chairman Role,3,294.08,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-some-tesla-inc-tsla-shareholders-want-ceo-elon-musk-removed/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to struggle in its quest to reach the ambitious production goals laid out by CEO Elon Musk, and some observers and shareholders are pointing fingers over what the real troubles at the company are. That may all come to a head at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting, especially when you consider one of the proposals that has been floated out there.   more
Gizmodo has the details on the situation that Tesla is facing.
It was only a few months ago that Tesla signed Elon Musk to stick around as CEO for another ten years. Since then, the electric vehicle company has been going through some tough time and when shareholders hold their annual meeting in June, they’re set to vote on a proposal to remove Musk from his role as chairman.
Elektrek reports that a shareholder named Jing Zhao is behind the proposal, and he notes that a number of large companies across the globe have a separate and independent chairman of the board. “Tesla should not be exception,” Zhao states in his proposal.
In a statement accompanying the proposal, Tesla’s board dismissed the idea, and pointed to Musk’s “day-to-day exposure to the Company’s business” as a reason for its success.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.29 (-0.44%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.55%, versus a 0.29% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long been a leader in the autonomous driving space, but the robust technological needs of self-driving cars are still yet to be truly met.more
However, as CNBC reports, one prominent Wall Street mind envisions a potential tie-up with Elon Musk’s other company on that front:
Autonomous cars produce and consume extremely large amounts of data, said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note sent Friday. He estimates self-driving vehicles can produce 40 terabytes of data in an hour, for example. Today’s self-driving vehicles transmit about 500 times the amount of data as a typical smartphone contract.
“How will Tesla manage such a large quantity of data?” Jonas said. “In our opinion, leveraging the broadband network provided by its very own sister company seems like a plausible answer.”
Jonas noted that Tesla could thus become a “captive customer” for SpaceX. The rocket maker is currently developing a broadband network that leverages satellites to beam large amounts of data back and forth.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $294.07 on Friday, up $8.59 (+3.01%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.55%, versus a 0.29% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

While many observers have expressed concerns about the executive turnover at Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), short-seller Jim Chanos seems to be particularly worked up about it. During an appearance on CNBC, he even went as far as to call CEO Elon Musk’s leadership into question.  more
CNBC passes along what he had to say about Tesla.
Musk “may be misleading investors,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “I think Elon Musk has crossed the Rubicon in terms of making statements to investors that he might rue later.”
The Kynikos Associates hedge fund manager, who confirmed his firm is short Tesla shares, cited Musk’s announcements about future products.
Chanos specifically called out Musk’s claims about the Roadster, which he said would be ready for the masses in 2020, and Tesla’s semi-truck, which Musk says will be entering production next year. “I don’t think either of those are going to happen,” Chanos said. As he sees it, there are serious problems afoot at Tesla, and he needs to look no further than the recent turnover for confirmation.
“The No. 1 sign of impending problems is mass executive departures,” he added. “This is becoming a torrent at Tesla. … [It is] stunning the accelerating rate of executive departures.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $283.60 per share on Thursday afternoon, up $2.91 (+1.04%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -8.91%, versus a 0.44% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

As Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to navigate its way towards actually meeting its lofty production goals, its efforts will continue without another key executive. The company’s Autopilot chief is taking his talents elsewhere after two years with Tesla.  more
Bloomberg has the scoop on the latest exit from Tesla.
Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot chief Jim Keller has left the company, the latest in a rash of executive departures at the electric-car maker led by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.
Keller, who joined the auto maker two years ago and has a background in chip development, had his last day as a Tesla vice president on Tuesday, the company said in a statement. He’s going back to semiconductor engineering, Tesla said.
Tesla has shuffled the decks to account for Keller’s departure, as one person will now be lead Autopilot hardware, while another will be tasked with running Autopilot software. The company acknowledged that Keller was moving on in a statement.
“Prior to joining Tesla, Jim’s core passion was microprocessor engineering and he’s now joining a company where he’ll be able to once again focus on this exclusively,” the statement read in part. “We appreciate his contributions to Tesla and wish him the best.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $278.43 per share on Thursday morning, down $2.26 (-0.81%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -10.57%, versus a -0.51% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The Better Business Bureau has offered up its assessment of how well Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) handles customer complaints. Let’s just say that the carmaker has another item to add to its lengthy to-do list. more
CNET passes along the BBB’s harsh assessment of Tesla.
Tesla just got a failing grade, and not from the many folks waiting for their Model 3 to come online. No, the Better Business Bureau gave the company an “F” for not resolving customer complaints, sometimes not even responding to complaints.
According to a report in the Mercury News, the BBB received 65 official complaints about Tesla, but only 23 were resolved satisfactorily. Of the remaining complaints, Tesla responded to 10 of them but didn’t offer an adequate solution and in 15 cases the company didn’t respond at all. In the remaining cases, the BBB says Tesla responded to the problem but either the customer rejected the response or didn’t notify the bureau that the issue had been resolved.
While some of the complaints examined appear to be of the trivial variety, others have to do with things such as warranty issues. As the BBB sees it, Tesla leaves a lot to be desired on the complaint resolution front. Tesla sees things differently, and the company has essentially dismissed the report.
“Tesla has the highest customer satisfaction ratings in the entire auto industry, and it’s not even close,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $283.46 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $0.09 (+0.03%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -8.96%, versus a -1.06% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has faced a number of challenges in recent times, and even more are on the way in the form of increased competition. For J.P. Morgan, that’s even more of a reason to stay away from the company’s shares.
more
CNBC has some insight from the firm on Tesla.
Tesla’s electric car sales will suffer due to increased competition from German automakers, according to J.P. Morgan.
The firm reaffirmed its underweight rating on Tesla shares, citing the electric car pipelines from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi.
Analyst Ryan Brinkman has also reaffirmed his $185 price target for Tesla. As he sees it, companies such as Daimler and Audi are going to have little trouble meeting their production goals in the electric vehicle market in the coming years, and that’s going to result in additional concerns for Tesla to deal with.
“When similarly priced high-end long-range electric vehicles become available from prestigious brands with strong reputations for both service and build quality, we believe this could represent a meaningful headwind for Tesla,” he wrote.

Has Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reached the point in which it’s simply “too big to fail?” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas indicates that may be the case, and he points to the size of the company’s U.S. workforce as the reason.  more
CNBC passes along his take on Tesla.
Morgan Stanley believes the size of Tesla’s U.S. workforce may become a big factor affecting the company’s long-term survival.
The firm’s analyst Adam Jonas noted Tesla employed 37,543 workers at the end of last year and predicted the number will increase to nearly 50,000 by 2019 or 2020.
In a note to clients, Jonas wrote that the company “may be more on the ‘too big to fail’ spectrum than the market realizes … the vast majority of [the company’s workforce is] in the United States, and across many states.” During the financial crisis, the U.S. bailed out a number of entities to insure their survival, including GM and Chrysler. While Tesla has reached nowhere near the level of productivity of either of those giants of industry, Jonas points out the trickle down effect inherent to auto-related jobs.
“Rule of thumb on the economic multiplier says that one auto-related job can support as many as seven other jobs throughout the economy,” he wrote.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.35 (-0.46%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -6.17%, versus a 1.43% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-19,Analyst: Batteries Are The Real Culprit For Tesla Inc (TSLA) Production Troubles,3,293.35,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-analyst-batteries-are-the-real-culprit-for-tesla-inc-tsla/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to navigate its way through various production setbacks, and there has been a ton of speculation as to what the real trouble is that prevents the company from reaching its goals. According to one firm, the carmakers battery production is the real culprit.  more
CNBC shares the firm’s take on Tesla’s troubles.
Tesla’s battery production for the Model 3 is the company’s real obstacle to putting cars on the road, not Model 3 assembly itself, said Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch on CNBC’s “Power Lunch.”
“The real concern for us ultimately is how many batteries they can make that fit the specs,” he said, adding that he thinks Tesla is having quality issues with the 2170 battery cells. The 2170 is a new cell found only in the Model 3.
Tesla has repeatedly gone public with production goals for its Model 3 and then failed to achieve them. CEO Elon Musk has reportedly emailed employees to inform them that round-the-clock production would be going into effect to get output where it needs to be. For Rusch, there’s a clear problem that the company needs to get a handle on.
“We think they have a quality issue with the move to the 2170s and the chemistry changes, and we think that is the real bottleneck here,” he added.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.55 (-0.53%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.78%, versus a 1.73% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

That escalated quickly. Reports recently emerged alleging poor workplace safety practices at Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and the state of California is now going to start poking around and see if there’s anything to it. more
Bloomberg has the details on a new item that has appeared on the plate of Tesla.
California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health said it has opened a new investigation into Tesla Inc. following a report about worker protections at the company’s lone auto plant in Fremont, California.
The state agency “takes seriously reports of workplace hazards and allegations of employers’ underreporting recordable work-related injuries and illnesses” and “currently has an open inspection at Tesla,” said Erika Monterroza, a spokeswoman for the state’s industrial relations department.
The report from earlier this week emanated from the Center for Investigative Reporting’s Reveal, and it alleged that the company was fudging numbers to make its safety records look better than they actually were. What’s more, the report indicated that founder and CEO Elon Musk’s personal preferences held more weight in some cases over potential hazards.
For its part, Tesla pushed back on the report in a blog post, referring to it as “an ideologically motivated attack by an extremist organization working directly with union supporters to create a calculated disinformation campaign against Tesla.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $293.01 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $5.32 (+1.85%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.89%, versus a 1.91% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Failure to reach production targets has led to a ton of criticism being leveled against Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), but the company is taking steps to to make those issues a thing of the past. In short, it sounds like business is about to pick-up at the automaker’s Freemont assembly plant.   more
Bloomberg has the news on Tesla’s plans.
Tesla Inc. jumped after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk laid out measures to boost production of his most crucial electric car and rein in expenses to achieve profitability.
The automaker’s Fremont, California, assembly plant will begin around-the-clock production to accelerate Model 3 output, Musk told employees in an email Tuesday. He acknowledged criticism that Tesla is “not a real company” until it generates profit and said this is a goal now that Tesla has more scale.
Tesla’s previous goal has been to reach a 5,000-a-week production target for the Model 3, but Musk indicates he wants to reach 6,000 per week by the end of June. Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, believes this is the kick in the pants that the carmaker has needed.
“This makes us more confident in Tesla’s ability to ramp Model 3 production to a level that will satisfy investors,” he wrote in a note to clients.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $296.78 per share on Wednesday morning, up $9.09 (+3.16%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.68%, versus a 1.86% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The chorus continues to grow louder that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be hitting the capital markets before too long. Another team of analysts predicts that production delays will lead to Tesla having to raise funds before the year is through. more
Marketwatch shares the firm’s take on Tesla.
A second team of analysts now says that Tesla Inc. likely will raise equity or debt this year and face more production delays with its Model 3, despite the Silicon Valley car maker’s assurances to the contrary on both counts.
Analysts at Bernstein said they expect “production delays and the specter of a capital raise to dominate investor attention” on Tesla TSLA, +1.98% in the next two quarters. Further Model 3 delays would not necessarily “make or break Tesla,” they said, but they would intensify the company’s cash burn.
The analysts at Bernstein are holding firm on their price target of $265 for shares of Tesla, and they have the equivalent of a neutral rating in place. As they see it, the company needs to “materially” reduce near-term operational and capital expenses spending to avoid another capital raise.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs came forward to express similar sentiments about Tesla earlier this month, and the firm lowered its price target to $195 while doing so.
Tesla Inc shares rose $6.23 (+2.17%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -7.60%, versus a 1.65% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-17,"Tesla Inc (TSLA) Halts Model 3 Production To ""Improve Automation""",3,291.21,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-halts-model-3-production-to-improve-automation/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is already well behind its initial production goals for its new low-priced Model 3 electric sedan.more
The EV maker originally planned on making 5,000 Model 3’s by the end of 2017. It later extended that goal to the end of March 2018, before slashing it to 2,500.
Now, it hopes to reach that original goal level by the end of July, but that seems impossible at this point. And as BuzzFeed News reports, Tesla has actually halted production right now in order to install some upgrades to its systems:
Just a few days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he’s feeling optimistic about his ability to speed up production on the company’s vehicles, the assembly line for the Model 3 in the company’s Fremont, California, plant has been temporarily shut down — again.
The announcement of the four- to five-day production pause for the Model 3 came without warning, according to Tesla employees who spoke with BuzzFeed News. During the pause, workers are expected to use vacation days or stay home without pay; a small number of workers may be offered paid work elsewhere in the factory.
The company says the move is aimed at improving automation, which seems strange, considering CEO Elon Musk tweeted the following just a few days ago: “Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.”
Tesla temporarily paused Model 3 production for the first time back in February, with the goal of boosting output once its systems come back online.
Tesla Inc shares fell $3.24 (-1.11%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -6.47%, versus a 0.58% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-16,Tesla Inc (TSLA) May Need To Revamp Autopilot Strategy,3,291.21,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-may-need-to-revamp-autopilot-strategy/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a number of items on its plate at the moment, ranging from production concerns to worries over its debt load, and the company may need to revamp another part of its strategy in the wake of recent developments. A recent fatal crash in California was followed by a public spat with the National Transporation Safety Board that shed a negative light on the carmaker, and the time may be now for Tesla to re-examine its autopilot ambitions.   more
Business Insider has some insight on what Tesla may need to do.
Autopilot is actually not Tesla’s biggest headache at the moment — sluggish production of the Model 3 sedan is. But Autopilot is turning into both a public-relations nightmare and an opportunity, a dynamic driven by the weak overall market performance of electric vehicles, which make up only about 1% of global sales. Self-driving cars are the cool new thing, and Musk isn’t going to miss out on that futuristic adventures, even as he has to yet again take to sleeping in Tesla’s factory floor in Fremont, CA to fix the Model 3’s problems.
David Friedman, Director of Cars and Product Policy and Analysis for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports, notes that Tesla’s system may not be as good as offerings from rivals. “Their driver monitor system isn’t as good as some other systems in terms of assuring that someone is paying attention,” he notes.
While it’s unlikely the company would tap the brakes on autopilot completely at this point, it certainly seems like an appropriate time to make sure that any and all kinks have been worked out.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $291.44 per share on Monday afternoon, down $8.90 (-2.96%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -6.39%, versus a 0.67% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-16,Report: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Has Been Underreporting Worker Injuries,3,300.34,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-report-tesla-inc-tsla-has-been-underreporting-worker-injuries/,"
The hits keep on coming from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and we’re unfortunately not talking about the company suddenly knocking it out of the park on production goals. Yet another negative story has started making the rounds about the carmaker, and this one suggests there’s some creative record-keeping going on in regards to safety numbers.  more
CNBC passes along the details on a new report that paints Tesla in a negative light.
Electric vehicle maker Tesla has mislabeled and under-counted workers’ injuries to make its safety record look better than it was, according to a new investigative report by RevealNews.org.
“Company officials labeled toxic exposures, muscle strains and repetitive stress injuries as personal medical issues or minor accidents requiring only first aid, lowering its official injury count,” said the report.
Sources that spoke to Reveal indicate that there were safety compromises made at the company’s Fremont factory for incredibly curious reasons. According to the sources, CEO Elon Musk is not a big fan of the color yellow, and that resulted in the factory floor not having clearly marked pedestrian lanes. As opposed to the standard yellow, lanes were allegedly painted different shades of gray.
While the Reveal reporters seem to have done a thorough job with the investigation, Tesla has disputed the findings and notes that any past safety concerns have already been addressed and dealt with.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $293.70 per share on Monday morning, down $6.64 (-2.21%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.67%, versus a 0.27% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has demonstrated yet again that he’s not shy about speaking up when he disagrees with something. This time, it was a report from The Economist that caught his attention, and Musk felt the need to hop on the Twitter machine to respond.   more
CNBC has the details on what the Tesla CEO had to say.
Elon Musk gave detailed financial guidance for Tesla — in a tweet at 1:11 a.m. PT Friday — boosting the electric car maker’s stock.
The tweet was a reply to The Economist.
The Economist posted that “Tesla will need to raise $2.5bn to $3bn this year, according to Jefferies, a bank.” Many hours later, Musk caught wind of what the publication had to say, and he responded while taking a shot at the outlet’s interest factor.
“The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it’s just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4, so obv no need to raise money,” Musk wrote.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $297.45 per share on Friday morning, up $3.37 (+1.15%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.46%, versus a 0.01% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-13,Social Media Warning Signs,3,294.08,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-social-media-warning-signs/,"
It’s quite the job we have here at StockNews.com in covering the sudden starts and stops of a volatile market. But more and more, social media is taking what would be just another day in the markets and adding new sizzle. While it can be entertaining, it can also be profitable. However, one has to be ready to pounce. For example, Tesla CEO Elon Musk loves to use Twitter, almost as much as President Trump these days. Sometimes, Mr. Musk is mocking a brokerage for giving bad commentary. This morning, he called out The Economist magazine for reporting an analyst call that said the company would likely need to raise $2.5-$3B. Mr. Musk replied with “The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it’s just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4, so obv no need to raise money.” Maybe it’s me, but I tend to get a bit nervous when the CEO of a huge company feels the need to vent publicly. I get it’s the thing to do these days, but it just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do.more

Advice for the Needy: Don’t Take Another Penny
Families and money matters can often cause rough situations, whether it’s parents and kids, siblings, estate matters, etc. We may have some family members that tend to be more needy than others, but who are also the most outspoken (funny how that is). The way to solve money situations can come down to one main philosophy. The person that is giving the monies is the person that is dictating what it shall or shall not be used for. The receiver either understands this rule or has the option of not having to. How they determine this is simple: don’t take another penny and then you can choose your own path. Being self-reliant is the only way one can eventually decide the path he/she will want to take. Anything else, it falls back to the giver to allocate what funds will be dispersed and for what purpose. These are lessons that may not have investing implications as we normally discuss, but if these decisions are made properly, investing can then be introduced into the family in a much more defined process. If this approach is too harsh, there is always the universal basic income approach (a hot topic today) and that is you give a specific amount of money to those in need in your family that they can do with as they please, but anything above that should be dictated as to where the monies shall be used.
Facebook for Money/Investing Topics
With Facebook so much in the news, I thought about what if there was a Facebook-like platform for all things money and investing. What would the information look like? My guess is that it would be broken down into people asking a lot of questions on things they don’t understand and then people offering up answers to things they never do themselves. Not to mention folks would only be talking about stuff they want others to know while concealing the reality of their actual financial situation. In a nutshell, basically just like Facebook is today. Money and investing is best left to those who live and breath the topic on a day-in, day-out basis. Find the best sources and you will be on the right course. Anything else is a waste of time.

2018-04-12,Tesla Inc (TSLA) In Hot Water With NTSB Following Comments,3,300.93,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-in-hot-water-with-ntsb-following-comments/,"
Another curious piece of news has reared its head in regards to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and this time it has to do with the National Transportation Safety Board. Reports indicate that the NTSB asked the carmaker to step aside from its probe into a fatal crash with one of its vehicles, and that the conversation wasn’t exactly of the pleasant variety.   more
Bloomberg has the details on Tesla’s reported flap with the NTSB.
The National Transportation Safety Board told Tesla Inc. on Wednesday that the carmaker was being removed from the investigation of a fatal accident, prior to the company announcing it had withdrawn from it, according to a person familiar with the discussion.
NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt relayed the decision in a call to Tesla’s Elon Musk that was described as tense by the person because the chief executive officer was unhappy with the safety board’s action. NTSB is expected to make a formal announcement in a release later Thursday, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Reports indicate that the NTSB wasn’t pleased with Tesla’s public comments that the driver was at fault in the accident. While that may or may not be the case, the NTSB hasn’t wrapped up its investigation as of yet. Tesla has released a statement disputing that the call in question was testy in nature, and also explaining why it withdrew from the investigation.
“We believe in transparency, so an agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable,” the statement read in part.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $297.58 per share on Thursday afternoon, down $3.35 (-1.11%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.42%, versus a 0.16% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

As Vertical Research Group analyst Gordon Johnson sees it, shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are going to be on sale in rather dramatic fashion by next year. The analyst has offered up a sell rating and his expectation for a price target, and let’s just say he’s not painting a pretty picture for Tesla.  more
CNBC passes along the analyst’s take on Tesla.
With so much competition in the electric car industry, Tesla’s stock will drop to $84 by the end of next year, Vertical Research Group analyst Gordon Johnson said. Vertical issued a sell rating on the stock earlier this week.
“Year-end [20]19, we think the stock will be $84,” Johnson told CNBC on “Closing Bell” Wednesday. Tesla was priced at more than $300 by the end of trading Wednesday.
Johnson’s main concerns for Tesla have to do with increasing competition and the company’s proclivity for failing to meet delivery and production goals. “Time and time again [Telsa has] targeted production numbers that they haven’t hit,” he said.
CEO Elon Musk continues to brush aside the various bearish takes on his company, which is reportedly setting its sights on new release goals for its upcoming Model Y.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $297.92 per share on Thursday morning, down $3.01 (-1.00%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.31%, versus a 0.08% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

While Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may have any number of issues that it’s sorting through on the production front at any point in time, there’s one area in which the automaker certainly isn’t lacking. That would be on the ambition front, and we can look to the latest scuttlebutt about the company’s goals for confirmation. more
CNBC has the details on Tesla’s future plans.
Tesla is targeting November 2019 as the start of production for its Model Y sport utility vehicle, with production in China to begin two years later, two sources told Reuters this week, shedding some light on the electric vehicle maker’s next project that could tax its resources and capacity.
Reuters has learned the Silicon Valley company led by Chief Executive Elon Musk is accepting preliminary bids for supplier contracts on the Model Y, a compact crossover companion to the Model 3 sedan. Tesla has given suppliers scant details about the program and had not provided a production time frame, but has now indicated the vehicle would begin to be built at its Fremont, California, plant in November of next year, the two sources with knowledge of the supply chain said.
Tesla has been the subject of a ton of criticism in recent weeks over issues with Model 3 production goals. Anticipation was high for the vehicle, as evidenced by 500,000 advance refundable targets, but the company is still trying to get to the point in which it can produce 5,000 units per week, or 250,000 Model 3’s per year.
As for the Model Y. Musk has previously hinted that the company would be shooting to produce 1 million units annually.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $300.93 per share on Wednesday afternoon, down $3.77 (-1.24%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.35%, versus a -0.77% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has debuted several other massive energy storage projects in Australia in the wake of the success of its giant Powerpack system. The system has received high praise from energy operators, but critics still abound inside of the Australian government.  more
Electrek has additional details on the perception of Tesla’s system in Australia.
Nonetheless, the Australian Energy Market Operator praised the performance of the system in a new report this month.
Tesla’s 100MW/129MWh Powerpack project in South Australia, the largest in the world for now, has been demonstrating its capacity since going into operation in December.
The EMO called attention to the battery system’s efficiency, affordability, and ability to get things done with zero emissions. While the results of the report are impressive, Australian resources minister Matt Canavan is among the officials that is less than impressed with Tesla’s offering.
“It’s the Kim Kardashian of the energy world: it’s famous for being famous,” Canavan said. “It really doesn’t do very much.”

Dissenting opinions on the future prospects of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are not a new phenomenon, but a bearish call on the stock from one of the street’s most respected names seems to have ruffled the feathers of CEO Elon Musk. Goldman Sachs views the stock as a sell, and Musk has publicly thrown shade on that assessment. more
CNBC shares the Tesla CEO’s take on the firm’s call.
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is calling out Goldman Sachs after the bank encouraged investors to sell the carmaker’s stock.
“Place your bets,” Musk quipped on Twitter, appearing to challenge would-be sellers to exit at their own risk.
In a research note, analyst David Tamberrino called attention to a number of trouble spots for Tesla, including his belief that the company will fail to achieve production goals. “We believe the sustainable production rate for the second quarter of 2018 is most likely below the 2,000 vehicle mark the company achieved in the final week of the [first] quarter,” he wrote. “We see the company likely sustaining Model 3 production around the 1,400 per week mark.”
The carmaker is holding firm on its stance that it will reach a goal of 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of June.

Trade tensions between the United States and China have led to concerns for automakers such as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), but an encouraging sign has emerged in the wake of all the tough talk that has been making the rounds. Chinese President Xi Jinping has offered up some wiggle room when it comes imports from carmakers. more
CNBC has the details on the positive news for Tesla and others.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said his plans include “significantly” lowering import tariffs on foreign autos and decreasing duties of other products.
“We have a genuine desire to increase imports and achieve greater balance of international payments under the current account,” Xi said at the Boao Forum for Asia, according to a translation of the speech.
China is a key market for US car companies, and it’s only expected to get larger in the coming years. Last year, GM sold more than 4 million cars in China, while Tesla doubled its revenue in the country to $2 billion. Fears of an all-out trade war between the two powers are on the decline, and even the commander-in-chief has indicated that cooler heads will likely prevail.
“President Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade,” he tweeted on Sunday. “China will take down its Trade Barriers because it is the right thing to do.”

Production targets remain elusive for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and there remains a ton of speculation as to whether or not the company will be able to meet any of the ambitious goals the company has outlined. We can count Goldman Sachs in the camp of those that believe that the reaching of goals will remain elusive for Tesla.  more
CNBC passes along the investment banking giant’s take on Tesla.
Goldman Sachs still isn’t convinced Tesla will be able to meet even its Model 3 production targets.
“We believe the sustainable production rate for the second quarter of 2018 is most likely below the 2,000 vehicle mark the company achieved in the final week of the [first] quarter,” Goldman analyst David Tamberrino wrote Tuesday. “We see the company likely sustaining Model 3 production around the 1,400 per week mark.”
Tamberrino has also dropped his price target for Tesla to $195 from $205, as he’s unconvinced that the company has worked its way through the numerous challenges on its plate at the present time.
“Although the company stated that is does not require a capital raise this year, we note that this is predicated upon a sustained 5,000 per week production rate achieved exiting the second quarter of 2018,” he added. “Beyond a required capital raise to continue to fund the launch of the Model 3 program, the company would likely still need outside capital in the future for capacity and product expansion.”

If all goes according to plan, 2018 could be a banner year for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other electric vehicle makers. That’s the assessment of consultancy firm McKinsey, which sees a clear path ahead for mass market adoption of EVs. more
Teslarati passes along that the firm believes Tesla and others need to do.
As Tesla continues to push the boundaries on automation in its factory production line, 2018 could be the year when the company and the electric vehicle (EVs) industry shifts from being seen as niche production to the mass market. Noting that roughly 1.3 million EVs were sold around the world in 2017, a 57 percent increase over 2016 sales, global consultancy McKinsey predicts that EVs’ share of total passenger vehicle sales could reach 30 to 35 percent in major markets like China, Europe, and the US by 2030. In partnership with automotive benchmarking specialist A2Mac1, McKinsey took a deep dive into EV technology, and identified four strategies that automakers should follow to remain relevant as the industry transforms itself.
McKinsey notes that exemplary progress has been made in driving range fro EVs, and the various automakers can now set their sights on reducing price points. To make that happen, McKinsey believes they will need to implement things such as design to cost strategies while also making sure they stay ahead of the curve in technology.
Of course, all of that is easier said than done. While there’s no doubt that Tesla and others have made impressive progress, it’s high time for the former to actually meet production goals before looking ahead to the days of mass market adoption.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $296.80 per share on Monday afternoon, down $2.50 (-0.84%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -4.67%, versus a -0.77% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-09,Model 3 Frustrations Lead Some Tesla Inc (TSLA) Buyers to Back Out,3,299.30,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-model-3-frustrations-lead-some-tesla-inc-tsla-buyers-to/,"
Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) production worries are not just a concern for the company and its shareholders. There’s also the little matter of those that have plunked down deposits on the Model 3, and some are questioning their decisions.    more
Marketwatch passes along the take of Vitaliy Katsenelson, CIO at Investment Management Associates, who is reconsidering his choice to purchase a Tesla.
I share this experience because I’m probably not the only one thinking this way. As the dollar meets the road and a lot of Model 3 depositors visit Tesla showrooms, they will likely have similar second thoughts. Consequently, Tesla may discover that lower Model 3 production levels will be sufficient to meet declining demand after a raft of deposit cancellations.
I am not short-selling Tesla stock, and outside of my $1,000 unsecured loan (my deposit) neither my firm or I have a position in Tesla. But it is becoming difficult to see how the Model 3 will be the car that leads Tesla to profitability. As for my deposit, I’ll be getting it back before it’s too late.
Concerns over the production delays are leading to worries that there will be even more bugs and whatnot for early Model 3 customers to deal with. When you add in the fact that we’re not exactly talking about the most budget-friendly vehicle on the market, it’s easy to see why some depositors are suddenly feeling hesitant as negative Tesla headlines continue to swirl around.
It looks like we can count Katsenelson in the camp of those that are thinking twice, and he may get even more company if Tesla’s Model 3 production struggles continue.

2018-04-09,Next Up For Tesla Inc (TSLA) CEO: Solar City Debt Concerns,3,299.30,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-next-up-for-tesla-inc-tsla-ceo-solar-city-debt/,"
Concerns over production goals have been front and center for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk of late, but that’s not the only issue on his plate at the moment. There’s also the little matter of debts that are coming due, and we’re not just talking about for the carmaker that’s churning through cash at a healthy pace. more
Bloomberg has the details on an additional debt concern for Tesla.
With all the car-making troubles that are hounding Tesla Inc. these days — from the Model 3 bottlenecks to the furious cash burn — it’s easy to overlook the company’s SolarCity headache.
But 16 months after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk kicked up controversy by acquiring the solar-panel installer founded by two of his cousins, its obligations are a strain on Tesla’s finances. The $2 billion purchase came with a $2.9 billion debt load, and a chunk of that is soon coming due. That’s bad timing for a company churning through about $6,500 a minute and trying to stave off the need for another capital raise.
According to the company, the solar business generated positive cash flow last year. While that may be the case, the debt load has still been a sore spot for shareholders, who are already concerned about the automaker’s own credit and debt concerns.
“SolarCity debt may not be the immediate cause of Tesla’s problems, but it certainly isn’t helping right now,” explained Covenant Review LLC analyst Alexander Diaz-Matos.
Tesla Inc shares rose $2.44 (+0.82%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.87%, versus a -2.29% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is rolling out a new feature that will make things easier for owners of its vehicles. Owners will now be able to directly request the latest firmware updates as opposed to waiting for them as they have in the past. more
Teslarati has the details on Tesla’s new feature.
Tesla owners will be given a feature that allows them to request the latest over-the-air firmware update for their vehiccles, according to Elon Musk.
Musk’s latest announcement came as a response to a Tesla owner and podcaster on Twitter. @teslatidbits stated that he spent half an hour poking around his car’s features due to Musk’s earlier references to the Tesla Easter Egg basket. The Tesla enthusiast also noted that he tried unsuccessfully to request an update for his car, especially since the new navigation and maps are currently being rolled out.
That post led to a direct response from Tesla head Elon Musk. “We will add a feature to allow request of latest software version,” Musk wrote. Reaction to the news was positive among Musk’s followers on Twitter.
Once the feature is offered up as Musk promised, Tesla owners will have greater control over when updates will arrive. Currently, updates are rolled out in a gradual manner across the fleet of Tesla vehicles.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the many companies that could find itself caught in the middle if a trade war between the US and China intensifies, but CEO Elon Musk understands that tariffs may be a necessary part of the game. Musk envisions a future in which China is a huge market for electric vehicles, but he understands President Donald Trump’s concerns about the trade imbalance.  more
CNBC has additional details on how Tesla is somewhat caught in the middle of a potential trade war.
Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk has long believed China will be a huge driver of electric vehicle sales, even outranking the United States one day. Wall Street analysts have expressed the same belief.
But as the trade war between the United States and China intensifies, Musk finds himself on both sides of the divide. The Chinese government is doing much more to support EVs than the U.S. government right now, but the 25 percent tariff that Tesla and other foreign automakers pay to sell in the Chinese market are steep.
In the past, Musk has come out in favor of the steps that the Chinese government has taken on the regulatory front to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles. However, he has also publicly come out to express support for Trump’s stance, and he noted that China imposes high tariffs on foreign automakers.
We’ll have to wait and see how a potential trade war will eventually play out, but signs continue to point to China being a massive potential market for Tesla regardless.

2018-04-04,Tesla Inc's (TSLA) Debt Load Is Eye-Opening,3,267.53,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-incs-tsla-debt-load-is-eye-opening/,"
There are plenty of concerns making the rounds about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) these days, but one of the more eyebrow raising has to do with the amount of debt the company is carrying. While the amount of debt is eye-opening enough, the company’s reported cash burn rate and the fact that its credit rating was recently cut has led to even more questions from investors. more
Automotive News has the details on Tesla’s debt burden.
For Tesla Inc. investors, the question isn’t whether Elon Musk will meet his diminished target this week for Model 3 car production. They’re wondering how he’s going to finance the ones that come later.
Wall Street has pretty much disregarded Musk’s joking April Fools’ tweet over the weekend that the company “has gone completely and totally bankrupt.” But Tesla’s $10 billion debt load is turning into a real burden as cash dwindles and its bonds continue to slide after the electric car maker’s credit rating was cut.
Over the next 12 months, Tesla will reportedly burn through $2 billion in cash and see $1.2 billion of its debt mature. Bruce Clark, a credit analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, notes that the company is probably “going to have to go to the capital markets in the not-too-distant future.” However, he cautions that concerns about production milestones not being met could make raising cash even more difficult for Tesla.
“Their credibility has taken some hits,” he explained.
Tesla Inc shares fell $12.18 (-4.55%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -14.07%, versus a -1.89% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

While the headlines point to storm clouds surrounding Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), the company is still in position to disrupt multiple industries. That’s the take from noted tech analyst Gene Munster, who is calling for investors to exercise some patience. more
CNBC passes along Munster’s take on Tesla.
Despite a recent barrage of bad news, Tesla is still poised to disrupt the energy and transportation industries, said tech analyst-turned venture capitalist Gene Munster.
Shares of the electric automaker have fallen under pressure as it is hit with headline after headline. The stock fell 22.4 percent in March, its second-worst month on record. The S&P 500 declined 2.69 percent over the same period.
Among the clouds that have surrounded Tesla are concerns about production numbers, and an ill-advised April Fool’s tweet from CEO Elon Musk that said his company was going “bankwupt.” Despite those and other concerns, Munster notes that he’s “still a believer” in both Musk and Tesla.
“Their mission statement is to accelerate the globe’s adoption rate of renewable energy,” he explained to CNBC. “This has little to do with a car. More about energy’s capture, storage in your home and then ultimately used in a vehicle.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $268.43 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $15.95 (+6.32%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -13.79%, versus a -2.04% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and production concerns seem to go hand in hand these days, but it sounds like CEO Elon Musk has come up with a solution to get to the bottom of things. Musk is now going to directly oversee production of the Model 3, pushing aside another company executive in the process. more
CNBC has the details on the changes at Tesla.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken charge of production of the company’s flagship electric sedan, pushing aside former Apple executive Doug Field, according to The Information.
Field, Tesla’s senior vice president of engineering, will focus on “vehicle engineering,” while Musk focuses on Model 3 production.
Musk has never been shy about laying out ambitious production goals, but Tesla has been unable to execute at that level. Last July, he estimated that 20,000 Model 3’s per month would be rolling off the line by December, but the company has been having a rough time making it to just 2,000 per week.
“Model 3 production is the highest priority at Tesla, so Elon is focusing his time there while Doug focuses on vehicle engineering,” according to a Tesla spokesperson.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has hit a rough patch in recent weeks due to a number of different issues, and there continue to be concerns about whether or not the company will be able to reach its ambitious production goals. According to an email from CEO Elon Musk, progress has been made on that front. more
Jalopnik passes along what the Tesla CEO had to say.
“If things go as planned today, we will comfortably exceed that number over a seven day period!” Musk wrote in the email, obtained by Jalopnik.
The message suggests the company rapidly exceeded production of the Model 3 over the past week. Bloomberg, which has been tracking production totals for the all-electric sedan, said over the weekend that Tesla had been hitting around 1,200 per week.
Musk was referring to the 2,000 vehicle per week rate, which would be a welcome surprise in the face of the report from Bloomberg. Ever the optimist, Musk would go on to explain that nothing but blue skies are ahead if the company continues on this track.
“This is already double the pace of 2017!” he added. “By the end of the year, I believe we will be producing vehicle sat least four times faster than last year.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $252.08 per share on Monday afternoon, down $14.05 (-5.28%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -19.04%, versus a -3.12% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-04-02,Latest Tesla Inc (TSLA) Decline Presenting Opportunity For Yet Another Bounce? (TSLA),4,266.13,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-latest-tesla-inc-tsla-decline-presenting-opportunity-for-yet-another/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) had a rough week last week, but the electric automaker’s shares could be preparing for yet another comeback.more
That’s according to CNBC, which points out that similar conditions have produced good returns before:
In the last two days, Tesla shares have fallen 15.3 percent. Such a two-day loss has occurred only six times since the electric car maker’s IPO in 2010.
A week after those losses, it returned an average of 3.96 percent, trading positively about 67 percent of the time, according to Kensho, a hedge fund analytics tool. However, if one looks at the individual instances that go into that average, the swings are notable…
The latest of those such bounces happened in February 2016, with a 4.85% return in the ensuing week. Tesla also saw bounces of 12% and 17% in 2013 and 2012 following similar two-day declines. However, the stock also fell 1.55% in the week following a big two-day loss in 2013, and 11.2% in 2010 during a similar setup.
Whether Tesla will see a big bounce or a continued meltdown this week remains to be seen, but the past paints an overall bullish picture for the stock.
Tesla Inc shares fell $7.88 (-2.96%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -14.52%, versus a -1.00% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) this week revealed more details about a recent fatal car crash that involved its self-driving system, Autopilot.more
Specifically, TSLA noted that the driver involved failed to heed the vehicle’s repeated warnings to assume control and steer away from danger.
“The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,” the electric automaker wrote in a blog post. “The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.”
TechCrunch provides some more details on exactly what went wrong here:
The promise of Tesla’s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents. In the company’s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government. Of course, that does not mean the technology is perfect in preventing all accidents.
As Tesla previously noted, the crash was so severe because the middle divider on the highway had been damaged in an earlier accident. Tesla also cautioned that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, but it does make them less likely to occur.
It hasn’t been a good month for self-driving systems. Uber shut down its entire autonomous driving fleet recently after one of its self-driving cars hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. The victim’s family has since settled a lawsuit with Uber.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $266.13 on Thursday, up $8.35 (+3.24%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -14.52%, versus a -1.00% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

If you own a Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S sedan, odds are you’ll be caught up in the electric automaker’s latest recall.more
As Bloomberg reports, Elon Musk’s embattled EV maker announced a massive recall this week to fix a steering part:
Tesla Inc. is recalling all Model S cars built before April 2016 to retrofit a power-steering component as the company caps its worst one-month performance in the stock market since December 2010.
The issue, which the carmaker said has not led to any accidents or injuries, impacts only the flagship Model S sedan, not the Model X sport utility vehicle or more affordable Model 3. The recall affects roughly 123,000 vehicles globally.
In am email sent to affected owners, the company said it’s making the move due to “excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts, though only in very cold climates, particularly those that frequently use calcium or magnesium road salts.”
“Nonetheless, Tesla plans to replace all early Model S power steering bolts in all climates worldwide to account for the possibility that the vehicle may later be used in a highly corrosive environment,” the email read.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $266.13 on Thursday, up $8.35 (+3.24%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -14.52%, versus a -1.00% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla is pulling out a number of stops to roll Model 3’s off of the assembly line, but that will temporarily come at the expense of Model S and Model X production. more
Bloomberg has the scoop on Tesla’s production push.
Tesla Inc. exhorted its factory workers to disprove the “haters” betting against the company wrong and asked for volunteers to join the effort to ramp up output of the crucial Model 3 line.
In a pair of internal memos last week, the heads of engineering and production spelled out measures to free up workers for the Model 3 line and challenged them to reach production goals. Doug Field, the engineering chief, told staff that if they can exceed 300 Model 3s a day, it would be an “incredible victory” at a time when short-sellers and critics are increasingly doubting the company’s ability to fulfill CEO Elon Musk’s vision of building a mass-production electric-vehicle manufacturer.
Bloomberg was able to get a look at an email that Field sent to staff last week, and it’s quite clear that he’s taking the scuttlebutt about the company’s production shortcomings personally. “I find that personally insulting, and you should too,” he wrote. “Let’s make them regret ever betting against us. You will prove a bunch of haters wrong.”
Tesla will suspend production of the Model S and Model X in the final days of the quarter to help reach its Model 3 goals, but the company notes that its ahead of schedule on the other models for the quarter.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $262.62 per share on Thursday afternoon, up $4.84 (+1.88%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -15.65%, versus a -0.50% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-29,Germany Will Offer Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model S Subsidies,3,257.78,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-germany-will-offer-tesla-inc-tsla-model-s-subsidies/,"
Back in December, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was removed from the list of vehicles eligible for subsidies in Germany. It appears as if the row has been resolved, as the German Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Controls has returned Tesla to the list of eligible vehicles. more
Reuters has the details on what that means for Tesla.
Tesla (TSLA.O) buyers in Germany can apply for subsidies again because a government agency has ended its dispute with the U.S. carmaker over whether its Model S was too expensive to qualify for the incentives scheme.
An independent assessment proved that a base version of the Model S was available for less than the 60,000 euros ($74,000) baseline and the cars are thus eligible, the German Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Controls (BAFA) told Reuters.
The move to take Tesla off of the subsidy list was unexpected to begin with. BAFA contended that the vehicles were too expensive to qualify, but Tesla denied that assessment.
An independent review was able to prove that Tesla was correct, and German customers are now eligible for subsidies once again.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $253.50 per share on Thursday morning, down $4.28 (-1.66%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -18.58%, versus a -1.63% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

A steady stream of negative news has been coming out on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) this week, and that’s led to additional speculation about what may be ailing the company as a whole. According to Max Warburton, European autos analyst at Bernstein, the problem may lie with the view from the top.    more
CNBC passes along Warburton’s take on Tesla.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is so focused on automating electric car manufacturing that it’s hurting the company’s ability to deliver on its Model 3 production goals, Bernstein said Wednesday.
“When it comes to auto production, Elon may have fallen in love with the wrong thing. He’s fallen in love with robots and automation,” Max Warburton, European autos analyst at Bernstein, said in a Wednesday report.
Warburton notes that there has been plenty of research done on automation, and he points out that the research reveals that the results of employing the concept are often in stark contrast to the principles of lean production. He’s a little confused as to why the company seems to be neglecting those findings.
“It appears [as] though Tesla has chosen to ignore it,” he said. “Or perhaps Tesla is convinced it’s out of date, in an age of better sensors and computers.”
Tesla Inc shares rose $2.77 (+1.07%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -17.21%, versus a -2.24% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

It appears that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors miffed at the electric automaker’s acquisition of SolarCity will finally have their day in court.more
As Bloomberg reports, a key ruling was handed down this week that allows a major class action lawsuit to proceed:
Tesla Inc. investors can press forward with claims that billionaire founder Elon Musk duped them into backing his $2.6 billion buyout of a solar-energy firm founded by his cousins, another setback in a rough week for the automaker.
Tesla shareholders challenging the acquisition of SolarCity Corp. produced enough evidence showing the deal may have been flawed by conflicts among Musk and other company directors, a Delaware judge ruled Wednesday. More than 85 percent of the company’s stockholders voted to back the acquistion.
Tesla said it disagrees with the judge’s decision, and will take whatever steps it can to try and rectify the situation. It maintains that the allegations in the lawsuit are false.
Critics of the deal have accused CEO Elon Musk of using his outsized influence to manipulate the board’s vote on the 2016 takeover. Others have dubbed the deal a “bailout” of SolarCity, a company that Musk’s cousin founded, and never came close to turning a profit.

It has been a challenging week for shareholders of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), as a steady stream of bad news has done a number on share prices. According to Morgan Stanley, there may be even more volatility to come for Tesla. more
CNBC shares the firm’s take on Tesla.
Tesla must quickly improve its Model 3 production rate if it wants to raise critically needed funds from investors at a decent price, according to Morgan Stanley.
The firm reiterated its equal weight rating on Tesla shares. The note came a day after the stock declined 8 percent on a negative analyst report and the National Transportation Safety Board’s announcement that it sent investigators to look into the fatal crash of a Tesla car last week. Moody’s also downgraded Tesla’s credit ratings after the close Tuesday.
Analyst Adam Jonas is sticking to his $379 price target for Tesla, but he pulled no punches in a note to clients. “A sharp drop in Tesla’s share price in part reflects questions on Model 3 ramp … an event that directly impacts both the company’s near-term cash needs and ability to potentially access the market for capital,” he wrote.
As he sees it, the company needs to ramp up production to place the current concerns in the rear view mirror, but he notes there may be some pain ahead if Tesla fails to do that. “A lower share price begets a lower share price… For a company widely expected to continue to fund its strategy through external capital raises, a fall in the share price can take on a self-fulfilling nature that further exacerbates the volatility of the share price,” he added.
Tesla Inc shares fell $0.23 (-0.09%) in after-hours trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -17.21%, versus a -2.24% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

For the most part, Wall Street seems to have shrugged off production issues that may come up along the way for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, those issues may finally be catching up with Tesla, especially when combined with concerns over the company’s cash burn rate.  more
As Bloomberg explains, Moody’s Investors Service has reacted to the concerns surrounding Tesla.
Tesla Inc.’s credit rating was downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday as the electric car company burns through cash, fails to meet production expectations and may soon have to raise more than $2 billion.
Moody’s cut Tesla’s overall rating to B3, or six levels below investment grade, from B2 and said its outlook on the company is negative. Tesla’s $1.8 billion of senior unsecured notes, issued in August, were downgraded to Caa1, seven steps into junk, from B3.
No comment has been forthcoming from Tesla on Moody’s concerns and downgrade. In his report, Moody’s analyst Bruce Clark called specific attention to the problems that have led to Tesla’s rating being dropped.
“Tesla’s ratings reflect the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company’s Model 3 electric vehicle,” Clark wrote. “The company also faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities.”
Tesla Inc shares fell $4.68 (-1.68%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -10.33%, versus a -1.95% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is preparing to investigate a fatal crash involving a Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model X vehicle in California. The news rattled Tesla shareholders, and share prices suffered as part of a broader market sell-off.   more
Electrek shares the details on the fatal Tesla crash.
Last week, a Tesla Model X driver died of due to injuries after his vehicle caught on fire in a crash on the highway in the Bay Area.
Today, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced that they are sending 2 investigators to conduct a “Field Investigation” of the accident.
The California Highway Patrol has reported that the vehicle struck the median barrier and quickly caught on fire before being hit by a pair of other vehicles. The NTSB is trying to get to the bottom of what happened, and the agency notes that it’s “unclear if automated control system was active at the time of the crash.”
“We have been deeply saddened by this accident, and we have offered our full cooperation to the authorities as we work to establish the facts of the incident,” said a spokesperson for Tesla.
Tesla Inc shares fell $0.68 (-0.24%) in after-hours trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -10.33%, versus a -1.95% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) navigation system has left a lot to be desired in the eyes of consumers for several years, but it looks like that’s finally about to change. CEO Elon Musk assures Tesla loyalists that an update is on the way this week. more
CNET has the details on Tesla’s update.
Musk also said in his tweet that this should be treated as a “mature beta,” but that functionality should improve rapidly. Electrek has been posting about these updates since a Tesla hacker friend of the site, known as verygreen, discovered the code for the new system in their car last summer.
The new navigation software will feature greatly improved routing as well as much more legible maps thanks to a new feature called “Vector Maps.” The software is of Tesla’s own design but relies on modules from MapBox and Valhalla, open-source mapping and routing programs, respectively.
Musk explained to followers that Tesla has been relying on third-party software for the systems, and that meant the company’s hands were tied when it came to updates and tweaking things. He promises that problem is a thing of the past, but he cautions there may still be some kinks to work through.
“New nav starts rolling out this weekend. Should be considered a mature beta at first, so won’t be perfect, but will improve rapidly,” Musk shared. “With the old system, we were stuck with legacy 3rd party black box code and stale data. No way to improve.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $295.66 per share on Tuesday morning, down $8.52 (-2.80%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -5.04%, versus a -0.30% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares re-entered bear market territory recently, plunging 20% from their yearly highs.more
But the heavily-shorted stock isn’t the only target for traders looking to profit from the electric automaker’s decline. As CNBC reports, Tesla’s corporate junk bonds are also seeing plenty of action:
Investors are betting against Tesla’s bonds amid growing worries about the electric car maker’s ability to deliver on its production goals, given significant delays for the Model 3.
“While equity short sellers continue to hang around, shorts in the most liquid TSLA bond have made a tidy profit so far in 2018,” Sam Pierson, director, securities finance, at IHS Markit said in a Monday note. “They have not covered to lock in the profit, suggesting that they think the credit will continue to deteriorate.”
Pierson noted that 99% of lendable supply for Tesla’s junk bonds has been used. That’s sent the cost of new net short positions to the highest level on record.
Tesla has issued several rounds of high-yield bonds in order to raise cash and expand production of its Model 3 sedan, which still lags well behind schedule. Critics worry that rising competition in the EV space, combined with production delays, could lead to consumers simply looking elsewhere for their next vehicle.
Tesla Inc shares rose $2.80 (+0.92%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -2.30%, versus a -0.26% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been running into troubles dealing with deliveries in Norway due to logistical issues. In response, CEO Elon Musk has encouraged the company to tap the brakes and slow things down when it comes to Norway deliveries.  more
CNBC has the details on Tesla’s delivery woes.
Tesla has been instructed to “slow down” on car deliveries in Norway this quarter, CEO Elon Musk said on Saturday, in response to woes the company has experienced delivering their vehicles.
On Twitter, Musk replied to a report stating that Tesla shipments in the country have been subject to accidents on the roads. The publication, called Electrek, said the car maker has had trouble finding “competent transporters” to deliver batches of cars, something a Tesla representative said the company was working to address.
Electric vehicles are quite popular in the country, and residents are said to be big fans of Tesla’s offerings. Last year, more than half of new vehicle registrations in the country were for electric or hybrid vehicles. Musk took to Twitter to explain why the company has to slow things down for the time being.
“It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery,” Musk wrote in part. “Customer happiness & safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.”

A source close to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) leaked some interesting details about CEO Elon Musk’s massive compensation plan recently.more
The unidentified person, who was present at a recent board meeting, noted that Musk would earn more than $50 billion in compensation over the next several years — if Tesla hits certain milestones. CNBC has more details:
The grant gives Musk $2.6 billion in stock options in 12 tranches that each vest as the company hits key performance milestones over 10 years.
Musk needs to hit 12 market capitalization milestones and 16 revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization targets in order to vest the entire award. Tesla has to reach a market cap of $100 billion for the first tranche to vest, and then each of the remaining 11 tranches require an additional $50 billion in market value.
Other milestones necessary for the full value of the deal to materialize are growing revenue from $20 billion currently to $175 billion, and various EBITDA milestones that range up to $14 billion.
In total, Musk could earn a whopping $55.8 billion in stock and awards, provided that Tesla’s market cap soars to $650 billion from $53 billion currently.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $301.54 on Friday, down $7.56 (-2.45%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -3.15%, versus a -2.91% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

A few top executives have decided to move on from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), but that’s not hampering the company’s standing in the eyes of job seekers. Tesla has taken down one of the top spots on LinkedIn’s recent ranking of hot spots for prospective employees. more
Teslarati has the details on where Tesla ranked in comparison to other top companies.
Tesla has made it to LinkedIn’s list of top companies that American professionals want to work for, placing 5th and outranking massive firms such as Apple and The Walt Disney Company. Companies who were considered in LinkedIn’s rankings were evaluated based on factors such as job seekers’ interest and engagement with the company, as well as job demand and employee retention.
Tesla comes on the heels of massive companies such as Amazon (#1), Google (#2), Facebook (#3), and Salesforce (#4), which dominate the top of LinkedIn’s list. Daniel Roth, editor-in-chief of LinkedIn, noted that Tesla’s bold style in the electric car industry seems to have become very attractive to job applicants across the country. Over the course of 2017, LinkedIn tracked 500,000 job applicants to the Elon Musk-led company.
Tesla reached a number of significant milestones last year, and that could be a big part of the appeal for applicants. The company unveiled the electric Tesla semi, which could very well disrupt the long-haul industry, and also debuted the world’s largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia, among other accomplishments.
LinkedIn also called attention to the company’s favorable practices in the eyes of employees, as the environment appears to encourage autonomy as opposed to micro-managing every step of the way.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $305.67 per share on Friday morning, down $3.43 (-1.11%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -1.82%, versus a -0.65% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) accelerated the launch of its Model 3 in Canada earlier this year, and it looks like the company is on schedule to make that happen. Invites have been sent out for configuration to Canadian customers, and the starting price for customers North of the border has been confirmed to boot.   more
Electrek has the details on Tesla’s plans for the Model 3 in Canada.
Tesla is finally starting to launch the Model 3 outside of the US for the first time – starting in Canada as previously announced.
The automaker is starting to send invites for configuration this week and it confirmed the Canadian price. Earlier this year, Tesla accelerated the planned launch of the Model 3 in Canada from “late 2018” to “mid 2018”.
Tesla has confirmed that the starting price of the Model 3 in Canada will be $45,600 CAD, which is roughly $350 more than the price for US consumers. Assuming timelines are similar for US and Canadian customers, deliveries could start as soon as next month.
The automaker has confirmed that the first batch of invites to configure have been sent out.

2018-03-21,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Shareholders Approve Massive Compensation Package For CEO Elon Musk,3,316.53,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-shareholders-approve-massive-compensation-package-for-ceo/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) can cross at least one item off of its lengthy to-do list. The debate over whether or not to award CEO Elon Musk with a hefty compensation package has come to a close, as shareholders have weighed in with the final word.  more
Bloomberg has the news on the decision from Tesla shareholders.
Tesla Inc. shareholders approved the board’s proposal to grant Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk stock options valued at $2.6 billion, paving the way for him to reap a big windfall if the electric-car maker maintains its growth trajectory over the next decade.
Investors holding a majority of the shares that were voted at Wednesday’s special meeting in Fremont, California, supported the performance award, a person with knowledge of the results said. The board needed majority approval to make the grant, which likely is the largest one-time compensation deal ever awarded. Tesla had said Musk and his brother Kimbal, who’s a company director, wouldn’t vote their shares.
The comp plan for Musk is tied directly to the company achieving its ambitious financial goals. In order for Musk’s options to fully vest, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion, which would make it larger than Facebook, and produce more on the revenue front than Procter & Gamble.
Advocates of the plan believe that the award will ultimately help Musk to drive the business even further ahead, but critics are confused as to why he would need even more equity to stay properly focused on Tesla’s goals.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $316.53 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $5.98 (+1.93%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 1.66%, versus a 1.33% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-21,Report: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Eyeing AI Partnership For Self-Driving Tech,3,310.55,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-report-tesla-inc-tsla-eyeing-ai-partnership-for-self-driving-tech/,"
Rumors are making the rounds that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is in talks with an Israeli-based AI startup called Cortica, which specializes in technology for autonomous cars. However, CEO Elon Musk has hopped on Twitter to throw cold water on those claims. more
BGR shares the scuttlebutt making the rounds about Tesla.
Interestingly enough, Musk recently traveled to Israel where he reportedly met with an Israeli-based AI startup called Cortica. Musk’s visit with Cortica is particularly intriguing given that the company specializes in AI for autonomous cars. Citing one person who claims to be familiar with the matter, Globes relays that the purpose of Musk’s visit is to examine the feasibility of incorporating Cortica’s technology into Tesla vehicles.
As to why Tesla is taking a keen interest in Cortica, the report notes that the company “is developing unsupervised machine learning systems that can understand a vehicle’s environment and identify objects while the vehicle is travelling.”
According to a note on Cortica’s website, the company’s autonomous AI technology “enables the vehicle to identify the moving parts in its environment and make informed decisions- even predicting the changes likely to occur in its surroundings.” After the story gained some considerable traction, Musk chimed in to refute it.
“This is completely false. Never even heard of Cortica,” Musk wrote. “Just taking my kids on a Spring Break trip to see ancient historical sites in Israel & Jordan.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $317.46 per share on Wednesday morning, up $6.91 (+2.23%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 1.96%, versus a 1.54% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-21,Bear Market May Be Looming For Tesla Inc (TSLA) Share Prices,3,310.55,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-bear-market-may-be-looming-for-tesla-inc-tsla-share/,"
Since reaching an all-time high last September, shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) have dropped more than 20 percent. Concerns over production continue to linger around the company, and the stock is teetering on the edge of bear market territory as a result. more
CNBC has additional insight into Tesla’s share prices.
Tesla shares are sinking into bear-market territory, as investors worry the company may not hit a key production milestone.
The stock was recently trading at around $310, which is more than 20 percent below its all-time high of $389.61, set in September 2017. To be in a bear-market territory, a sign of very negative investor sentiment, the shares would need to close at $311.69 or lower.
At the top of the list of investor concerns are worries that the company is going to miss the boat on Model 3 production goals. The enthusiasm over the new model was partially behind the stock’s run-up to all-time highs, but signs continue to point to Q1 production goals being missed.
“There is a growing consensus that they are going to miss their Model 3 production forecast for the first quarter,” CFRA analyst Efraim Levy said in an interview with CNBC.
Tesla Inc shares rose $0.35 (+0.11%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.26%, versus a 1.53% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-20,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Pushing Down Towards Key Technical Levels,3,310.55,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-pushing-down-towards-key-technical-levels/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) share prices are heading towards key technical levels. Analyst Nigam Arora has done some digging into the charts to make sense of things, and he’s passed along what he found. more
Marketwatch shares Arora’s take on Tesla.
The chart shows Tesla Whac-a-Mole. Lately when there is bad news for Tesla, buyers step in around $300, often driving the stock higher. In the past month, investors drove the stock to $357.
The chart shows that Tesla’s stock is below the 200-day moving average. There is no magic by itself to the 200-day moving average. However, many investors believe that a stock trading below that level is bearish. Sometimes this belief on the part of a large number of investors becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Arora points out that volume has been spiking on down days for Tesla, which he points to as a clear bearish signal. He adds that Tesla seems to trade based on technicals and sentiment while fundamentals are essentially dismissed by investors.
It’ll be interesting to see if Tesla pushes all the way down through the $300 price point, as Arora notes that it appears to be a key psychological level for the company’s share price.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $310.15 per share on Tuesday afternoon, down $3.41 (-1.09%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.39%, versus a 1.49% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

While Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) takes plenty of hits for its various hiccups in the production of its vehicles, some fans give the company a pass while pointing to the brand loyalty that Tesla inspires. Based on some recent findings by Bernstein Research, that line of thinking may be due for some closer examination.   more
Marketwatch shares Bernstein’s findings on Tesla.
Tesla Inc. fans have waited a long time for the chance to buy the electric-car company’s Model 3 sedan, but an analyst said Monday that many didn’t jump at their first chance to buy one.
Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi Jr. said among that the most recent group of reservation holders to receive purchasing privileges — existing owners of the company’s previous cars, the Model S and Model X — less than 30% opted to configure and purchase the car when given the chance. That was just the second group to receive access to purchase a Model 3, after Tesla employees.
Tesla is betting big that the Model 3 will be a huge hit, and Chief Executive Elon Musk has touted that the company received 455,000 reservations as of late last year. That said, many deposits are refundable at this stage of the game, as not all reservation-holders have been locked in with configurations for the vehicles.
“If correct, this take rate would be substantially worse than predicted by our July 2017 survey, which had indicated that up to 69% of S/X owners with reservations were likely/very likely to take delivery of their Model 3,” Sacconaghi noted.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $311.30 per share on Tuesday morning, down $2.26 (-0.72%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.02%, versus a 1.49% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reached a major deal with the South Australia government earlier this year for what would be the world’s biggest virtual power plant. Fast forward to today, and a changing of the guard has led to a wrench being thrown into Tesla’s plans. more
Electrek has the news on a new problem that Tesla is faced with.
Earlier this year, Tesla announced that it reached a deal with the South Australian government to install solar arrays and Powerwalls on 50,000 homes to create the biggest virtual power plant in the world.
Now, new Premier of South Australia, Steven Marshall, a member of the Liberal party who just replaced the Labor party this week, made his intention clear that his administration doesn’t plan to go through with the rest of Tesla’s plan.
While Marshall’s announcement doesn’t mean the project will be coming to a screeching halt, he’s not interested in advancing things beyond what the previous administration has already approved. “We don’t have any plans to stop what they have signed up to but we certainly don’t have any plans whatsoever to change one single component of our energy solution,” eh said.
The deal was touted as eventually reaching 50,000 homes, but only 1,100 installations were actually secured with funding by the previous administration.
Tesla Inc shares rose $0.94 (+0.30%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 0.71%, versus a 1.36% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

For the most part, concerns about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) being behind schedule are met with shrugs up and down the street. However, Goldman Sachs is more concerned than most, and the firm is reiterating its bearish stance on Tesla as a result.  more
CNBC passes along the firm’s prediction on Tesla’s share price.
Tesla’s troubles manufacturing the Model 3 are far from over, according to a top Wall Street firm.
Goldman analyst David Tamberrino reaffirmed his sell rating for Tesla shares, predicting Model 3 deliveries will come in below expectations.
In a note to clients, Tamberrino pointed to what the firm believes will be a “slow ramp” for the Model 3. The firm estimates that just 7,000 will be delivered in the first quarter, well below the consensus estimate of 13,800. Tamberrino sees Tesla’s share price taking a hit as a result, and he’s holding firm on his $205 six-month price target.
“We continue to expect a slow ramp for the Model 3, and maintain our Sell rating as we expect shares to de-rate as targets are potentially pushed further out,” he wrote.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $311.05 per share on Monday afternoon, down $10.30 (-3.21%). Year-to-date, TSLA has declined -0.10%, versus a 0.96% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-17,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Could Benefit Most From Potential EV Tax Credit Cap Reform,4,321.35,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-could-benefit-most-from-potential-ev-tax/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been a big beneficiary of electric vehicle tax credits at home and abroad.more
Considering it only builds electric vehicles, every car it’s sold to this point has come with a juicy government-subsidized discount. In the U.S., this comes in the form of a federal tax credit.
But Tesla is about to hit cap for these credits, if it hasn’t already. The results could be massive for its business, as consumers may simply buy an EV from another company instead to reap the full tax reward.
However, as Electrek reports, there’s a new push to do away with the cap, and extend EV credits indefinitely:
Some politicians and electric utilities are now pushing the idea to remove the cap of 200,000 electric vehicles sold per manufacturer in order to get access to the federal tax credit just as Tesla and GM are about to hit the threshold.
In the US, like in several other countries around the world, the federal government has long been offering an incentive for car buyers to buy electric vehicles in order to represent the value those vehicles have for the environment over gas-powered vehicles.
Democratic U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon is leading the charge to remove the cap, and he has the backing of 36 major electric utilities as well. It’ll be interesting to see how the situation plays out, considering the GOP recently wanted to do away with the EV credit, while Democrats clearly want to extend it significantly.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $321.35 on Friday, down $4.25 (-1.31%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 3.21%, versus a 2.75% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-14,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Employees Say Flawed Parts Are Affecting Production,2,326.63,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-employees-say-the-company-is-manufacturing-a-high-ratio/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has come to be known for putting forth ambitious timelines for its offerings and then struggling mightily to reach them, and that’s led to plenty of questions as to why that’s the case. According to sources, flawed parts are a huge part of the problem. moreCNBC has the scoop on where some current and former employees of Tesla are pointing their fingers.
Luxury automaker Tesla is manufacturing a surprisingly high ratio of flawed parts and vehicles, according to several current and former employees, leading to more rework and repairs than can be contained at its factory in Fremont, California.
Tesla’s future as a mass-market carmaker hinges on efficient, automated production of the Model 3, which more than 400,000 people have already reserved, paying $1,000 refundable fees to do so. Musk said in July 2017 that Tesla would probably be making 20,000 Model 3s per month by December.
According to one current engineer at the company’s Fremont factory, a staggering 40 percent of the parts made or received at the factory require some sort of rework. Other employees have hit similar notes, and that’s leading to an inability to hit goals, which is in turn hampering employee morale.
A spokesperson for Tesla has denied the claims noting “Our remanufacturing team does not ‘rework’ cars.”
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $326.80 per share on Wednesday afternoon, down $15.04 (-4.40%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 4.96%, versus a 3.08% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a tendency to shoot for the moon when it comes to production goals for its models, but that doesn’t translate into the company actually being able to achieve those goals. The same scenario appears to be playing out with the Model 3, but there’s a good chance the markets will continue to just shrug it off.  more
Business Insider has the news on how Tesla may miss the mark on Model 3.
This is hardly shocking. The entire Model 3 rollout has been, to put it mildly, a mess. But so what? The Model S rollout wasn’t exactly perfect, and the first six months of Model X SUV production introduced the Teslarati to Elon Musk’s favorite term — “production hell” — and found the CEO sleeping on the floor of his Fremont, CA factory.
Musk once said that Tesla would be selling 500,000 vehicles by the end of 2018. The Model 3 would have accounted for roughly 400,000 of that ambitious total (Model S and X assembly is likely capped at around 100,000 annually). I’m happy to be proven wrong here, but I don’t think Tesla is going to make it.
By the end of this month, production of the Model 3 is supposed to be at 2,500 per week. According to Bloomberg estimates, the number will be closer to 1,000. For other automakers, that would be a huge red flag that impacted share prices, but Tesla investors have continually shown a willingness to look past the company’s tendency to overestimate its own capabilities.
We’ll have to wait and see if the same thing happens this time around, but history points to it being a safe bet.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $335.54 per share on Wednesday morning, down $6.30 (-1.84%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 7.77%, versus a 3.87% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Pain at the pump and driving a Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicle don’t exactly go hand-in hand, but that doesn’t mean that Tesla owners don’t feel a strain on their wallets pretty regularly. In fact, that strain is about to become even more noticeable in the wake of a recent price increase at the company’s network of charging stations.     more
The Verge has the details on Tesla’s price bump.
Tesla drivers may enjoy a vast network of Supercharger stations across the US, but it’s coming at a cost: the price of charging. The automaker has quietly raised prices per kilowatt hour for using the fast-charging stations.
The average increase for pay-per-use customers ranges from roughly 20 to 40 percent, according to Electrek. In California, for example, the price went from 20 cents per kWh to 26 cents. In Oregon, the price doubled from 12 cents to 24 cents, and New York’s went up five cents to 24 cents per kWh. Owners of new Model S and Model X vehicles continue to have 400kWh of credit per year, while Model 3 drivers have no credits.
Across North America, there are more than 1,100 Supercharging stations. Tesla ownership is slated to increase dramatically this year, and that will put additional strain on the network itself.
In a note on its Supercharger website, the company notes that the stations “will never be a profit center.”

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has little trouble dominating the headlines when it comes to futuristic vehicles, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only company with some exciting plans in the works. The recent Geneva Auto Show helped to crystallize exactly how crowded the market is about to get. more
The Verge shares the details on some exciting competitors that should have Tesla looking over its shoulder.
The difference with this particular show, more than others past, is that it was filled to the brim with clear, serious competitors to Tesla. And I don’t just mean direct comparisons, with cars like the Jaguar I-Pace, which matches up almost spec for spec to something like the entry-level Model X. The show was also dominated by cars that slot into the parts of the market that Tesla thrives in. More luxury EVs and hybrids are coming than ever before, and for the rest of us, there are now multiple cheaper options for something other than the Model 3.
The I-Pace is open for orders with delivery scheduled for the second half of this year, and it comes in at a lower starting price point than several Tesla models to boot. Porsche was also at the show to showcase its upcoming plans, as were names such as Audi, Hyundai, and BMW.
In short, those in the market for an EV or hybrid vehicle are about to have a ton of options to sort through, and that news should put a little pep in the step of Tesla to insure it meets timelines with its latest models.

It seems like just about every company out there is worried about what Amazon is up to these days, and it looks like we may want to add Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to that lengthy list. That’s the word from noted Tesla analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who has offered up some insight into his feelings on the potential threat that may be looming down the road.     more
CNBC passes along what Jonas had to say in a note to clients.
“We expect that Tesla will successfully overcome bottlenecks and ramp Model 3 production throughout 2018. The boost to cash flow and sentiment provides a selling opportunity before facing further headwinds,” analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients Friday.
“Where we have substantially higher conviction on the Tesla story is our longer term thesis that the company will face greater levels of competition than the market anticipates in the domains of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and shared mobility.”
For Amazon specifically, Jonas added that the company “has a vested interest in taking the marginal cost of transportation to its lowest possible level.” While that doesn’t mean that the tech giant will jump head first into logistics, Jonas points to “the scale that large e-commerce players can bring, which could lead to surprisingly deflationary long-term trends in some of Tesla’s core initiatives.”
Morgan Stanley maintains its equal weight rating for Tesla, and the firm is sticking to its $379 price target.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $324.28 per share on Friday morning, down $4.82 (-1.46%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 4.15%, versus a 3.73% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Eric Branderiz, who also served as corporate controller, left Tesla for personal reasons on Wednesday, according to a regulatory filing. Tesla shares dropped as much as 1.9 percent after the close of regular trading.
Branderiz’s exit is just the latest in a string of high-level departures from the company, including Jon McNeill, president of global sales and service. Besides McNeill, the company has also lost Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler, Kurt Kelty, director of battery technology, and Diarmuid O’Connell, vice president of business development.
Next month, shareholders will have to decide on a $2.6 billion equity award for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, which is designed to help keep him with the company for the long term.
Tesla Inc shares fell $4.85 (-1.47%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 5.70%, versus a 2.71% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-08,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model S Enthusiasts Itching For Upgrades,3,332.30,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-model-s-enthusiasts-itching-for-upgrades/,"
While the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S has had little trouble winning fans since its release in 2012, some enthusiasts are hoping for a redesign of the car they’ve grown to love. A recent thread popped up on Reddit that outlined some of the items that are at the top of the list.   more
Business Insider has the details on what customers are hoping to see from Tesla in the future.
Some Tesla fans and customers have taken this moment to speculate on what a redesigned version of the Model S might bring. In a Reddit thread titled, “Model S Refresh – what features are you expecting,” one user opened the discussion by asking other users what features a new version of the Model S would need to justify buying it over the Model 3, which starts at a little under half the $74,500 base price for the Model S.
While those who participated in the thread had a variety of requests, they seemed to converge on a few features: a redesigned interior, heads-up display, and a bigger battery.
Tesla has its hands full on a number of other projects these days, and there’s no sign that a redesign of the Model S will be in the offing anytime soon. That said, it’s valuable feedback for the automaker, which will obviously want to insure it’s hitting the right notes for luxury electric car shoppers.
As Autotrader executive editor Brian Moody explains, progress that has been made on the company’s Model 3 has not been lost on buyers in that market. “What luxury buyers don’t want is to have something where the less expensive car is … ‘nicer,'” he said.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $330.24 per share on Thursday morning, down $2.06 (-0.62%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 6.07%, versus a 2.52% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-08,First Tesla Inc (TSLA) Semi-Trucks Hit The Road,4,332.30,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-first-tesla-inc-tsla-semi-trucks-hit-the-road/,"
Anticipation is high for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) semi-trucks, which already have customers lining up for their targeted release in 2019. A notable production milestone has been reached, as the first of the trucks have left the Nevada Gigafactory for a road trip.  more
Ars Technica has the details on Tesla’s big news.
On Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a picture on Instagram of two Tesla Semis at the Sparks, Nevada Gigafactory. The trucks are apparently full of battery packs and are making their way to the Tesla factory in Fremont, California.
“First production cargo trip of the Tesla Semi heavy-duty truck, carrying battery packs from the Gigafactory in the Nevada mountains to the car factory in California,” Musk wrote.
Tesla announced the electric big rigs last November, and companies such as Walmart and DHL are reportedly interested. The company has projected that they’ll be ready for sale in 2019, but Tesla has noted that they’ll be used internally first, presumably as a means of working out potential kinks before they hit the market.
There’s no word on whether the trucks will be making the full round trip on a single charge or if there will need to be a pit stop for charging purposes.

2018-03-07,Survey Says Big Surge In Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model 3 Sales Coming Soon,3,328.20,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-survey-says-big-surge-in-tesla-inc-tsla-model-3/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) already has hundreds of thousands of people waiting in line to buy a Model 3 electric sedan.more
The would-be owners have plunked down a $1,000 deposit for the chance to own the new EV, which is still being produced in extremely limited quantities. Tesla hopes to ramp up production of the $35,000 car later this year after several months of delays.
Now, as Inverse reports, that initial price tag may not reflect consumers’ true demand for the automobile, according to famous Wall Street analyst Gene Munster:
Munster’s firm, Loup Ventures, “surveyed 519 people in the U.S. regarding interest in buying a Tesla Model 3… [and] found a surprisingly high number (17 percent) of people would buy a Model 3 at $40,000. Even if this survey is off by [a factor of three], the results still imply significant market share gains are in store for Tesla given their current U.S. unit market share is below 0.5 percent.”
Munster noted his long-term forecast is for Tesla to own 17% of the U.S. auto market. However, that will take 10 years or more to achieve.
In the meantime, the automaker should make up around 1.5% of the total U.S. auto sales by the end of 2019 — with plenty of additional speed bumps along the way.

2018-03-06,Proxy Group Cries Foul On Tesla Inc's (TSLA) Board Over Musk Comp,3,333.35,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-proxy-group-cries-foul-on-tesla-incs-tsla-board-over/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may grant CEO Elon Musk a massive stock reward for his efforts, but a proxy advisory firm is requesting a closer examination of that generosity. Glass Lewis has expressed a number of concerns about the proposal, including that it seems to skew Musk’s value in relation to other executive compensation packages. more
Reuters has the details on the recommendations from Glass Lewis.
Influential proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shareholders should vote against a proposal to grant Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk performance-based stock options worth about $2.62 billion.
If Musk earned the full grant, he would own 28.3 percent of the company, although Tesla’s proxy statement showed that his ownership was expected to be lesser, Glass Lewis said in a report dated Feb. 28.
The proxy firm used a different valuation model when taking a look at the award, and it estimates it would actually be worth a whopping $3.7 billion. According to the firm, “the cost of the grant is staggering relative to executive compensation levels among public companies worldwide.”
Glass Lewis is also concerned that the proposed award to Musk would dilute the company’s other investors.
Tesla Inc shares rose $2.15 (+0.64%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 7.07%, versus a 2.00% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk revealed on Twitter over the weekend that his company’s much-anticipated update to its in-car navigation app is nearly complete.more
Electrek has more details on the long-awaited update, which promises to bring significant improvements over the current system:
We have been reporting on details of Tesla’s new in-house navigation and maps engine for the better part of a year now and back in December, CEO Elon Musk said that it was ‘light years ahead’ of the current system and coming in ‘early 2018’.
Now a few months into 2018, Musk says that the upgrade is ‘almost done’.
The new system is appropriately dubbed “Tesla Maps,” and relies on a vector graphics-based system for smooth visuals. These improvements reportedly make for more detailed maps and overall less laggy performance.
Elon Musk also noted that his software team was laser focused on improving the Model 3 sedan’s software right now. That system still isn’t anywhere near completion, despite the fact that the company started producing the cars back in July.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long benefitted from EV tax breaks from various world governments, but now one European country is taking accommodation to a whole new level.more
As The Guardian reports, a prominent Greek businessman is offering a massive facility for Tesla’s use at no cost whatsoever:
Tesla’s plans for the country have such “game-changing potential” that the head of the Hellenic Entrepreneurs’ Association, Vasilis Apostolopoulos, has pledged to hand over his own industrial plant for free as a testing ground for new products.
Addressing delegates at the annual Delphi economic forum, Apostolopoulos said: “I have personally emailed Musk to welcome Tesla Greece … and to say that for the next 10 years I will give, at zero cost to his company, my group’s own industrial plant outside Corinth so that Greece can be on the frontline of global innovation.”
Three of Tesla’s top engineers that hail from Greece are reportedly planning to move back to Athens as part of the development. These talented workers include principal motor designer Konstantinos Laskaris, motor design engineer Konstantinos Bourchas, and staff motor design engineer Vasilis Papanikolaou.
“It is the least we can do to thank and welcome Mr Musk’s vote of confidence in Hellenic business, research and technology,” Apostolopoulos concluded.

While Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may be the beneficiary of most of the hype and press when it comes to electric trucks, other automakers are positioning themselves for a piece of what could be a rather large pie. Mercedes-Benz is one of the names at the top of the list, as the company has some ambitious plans of its own for the space.  more
Teslarati has the scoop on a battle that may be brewing between Tesla and Mercedes-Benz.
While Tesla Semi “leaks” and spy footage continue to emerge and drive up interest in Elon Musk’s upcoming, all-electric truck, other companies that already have a long history in the transportation industry have been plugging away at making electric trucks, including on-road test models and, in some cases, production models that are already being built and sold.
Chief among those competitors is Daimler, who has already put some electric trucks into production and has plans for many more. Daimler is also the world’s most prolific commercial truck maker with operations around the globe with brands such as FUSO, Freightliner, and Mercedes-Benz leading many markets for commercial vehicle sales.
Tesla has been touting its plans to roll out electric trucks by 2019, but Mercedes-Benz has cast shade on those claims. Mercedes-Benz is working on its own electric big rig models, but the company has indicated that the tech has only advanced so far at this stage of the game.
Regardless of who gets to market first, it’s quite clear that there’s big interest in electric big rigs, and that should lead to plenty of jockeying for market share.
Tesla Inc shares fell $3.93 (-1.19%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 5.35%, versus a -0.28% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-03-01,Porsche Is About To Give Tesla Inc (TSLA) Some Major Charging Network Competition,3,343.06,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-porsche-is-about-to-give-tesla-inc-tsla-some-major/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been the king of EVs in the United States for the past few years, with its fast cars and growing Supercharger network giving it a major leg up on the competition.more
But as Ars Technica reports, those factors are about to change:
Porsche and other members of the Volkswagen Group will build out a network of fast-charging infrastructure in Europe and here in the US. Right at the beginning of the project, it was decided the Mission E would use an 800V electrical architecture to allow for rapid recharging—250 miles in less than 20 minutes being the plan. In Europe, VW Group is working with other OEMs in a consortium to make that happen, but here in the US it will go it alone.
Along with the fast-growing charging network, Porsche will also roll out a the Mission E — a sleek four-door sedan that will deliver 600hp (447kW) and 310 miles (500km) of range from a 95kWh battery pack. That’ll make it the first real worthy adversary on the market for the Tesla Model S. Mission E is due out later this year.
Clearly, other automakers are lining up to beat Tesla at its own game. It’ll be very interesting to see if Tesla can handle the massive influx of EVs into the market — not to mention competitors’ charging stations as well.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.06 (-0.31%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 10.18%, versus a 1.79% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-02-28,Production Quality Of Tesla Inc (TSLA) Called Into Question,3,350.99,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-production-quality-of-tesla-inc-tsla-called-into-question/,"
When examining the build quality of Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3, first impressions have been generally positive. However, closer inspection points to room for improvement in the vehicle’s manufacturing processes. more
Business Insider‘s Matthew DeBord offers up his impression, which echo other early customer reviews.
Build quality is both general and specific. If you look at a Tesla vehicle, the overall impression is usually pretty good. They’re beautifully designed, with a vibe that’s classic and futuristic.
But if you focus, you may notice body panels that aren’t consistently spaced, known as “panel gaps.” Or misaligned door handles. Or interior plastic components that look really plasticky. Or upholstery that’s crinkled. Or other various minor components that aren’t up to snuff for a vehicle that can cost $100,000.
DeBord also calls out other inefficiencies he came across on the test vehicle, including steering-wheel stitching that seems to be a bit off. As Tesla has ramped up production through the years, overall build quality has also been on an upward trajectory.
However, it appears that there’s still some kinks to be worked out in the company’s overall manufacturing processes.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $353.98 per share on Wednesday morning, up $2.99 (+0.85%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 13.69%, versus a 3.25% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-02-27,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Dreams Of Epic Solar Roof Are Approaching Reality,3,357.42,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-dreams-of-epic-solar-roof-are-approaching/,"
Back in January 2017, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) revealed a bold ambition for its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada. Tesla noted that it wanted to construct “the world’s largest solar rooftop array” at the facility, and it looks like the company is starting to deliver on that promise.   more
Electrek has the details on Tesla’s progress towards yet another ambitious goal.
The Gigafactory 1 has a giant roof in the middle of the desert so it makes sense to install a giant solar array on top of it.
But a year after the announcement, there was no sign of a solar array at Tesla’s battery factory… until now.
The latest satellite imagery of the Gigafactory 1 construction site shows that solar panels are finally coming up on the north side of the factory.
All told, Tesla hopes to power the sprawling Gigafactory 1 entirely from renewable energy. The massive planned 70 MW rooftop array is a huge step towards making that happen, and it would take down the crown of largest of its kind in the world upon completion.
Tesla also has a Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo. That plant, where they manufacture solar products with Panasonic, is powered by hydro-electricity.
Tesla Inc shares fell $1.17 (-0.33%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 14.80%, versus a 4.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-02-26,Market Size Expectations Are Climbing For Tesla Inc (TSLA) Semi-Trucks,3,352.05,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-market-size-expectations-are-climbing-for-tesla-inc-tsla-semi-trucks/,"
Anticipation is high for Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) entry into the semi-truck market, but questions abound about how much interest there will actually be for the company’s electric big rigs. According to CEO Elon Musk, there’s going to be a whole lot of it.    more
Clean Technica has the details on the increasing expectations for Tesla’s semi-truck market size.
Then Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on the recent quarterly conference call that he thinks Tesla could end up selling 100,000 Tesla Semis a year (which is similar to the Model S + Model X total, by the way). I thought, “Hmm, maybe I’ll finally get to that story.”
Then a DHL exec came out and basically said that the low cost on the Tesla Semi blows the competition out of the water, earning back its extra cost compared to a conventional diesel semi truck in only 1½ years. Quite humorously, this came right after a Daimler truck exec claimed the Tesla specs broke the laws of physics. It appears DHL disagrees with its German neighbor. And maybe 100,000 Tesla Semi sales a year is a genuine possibility.
The thoughts from the DHL exec are quite telling and point to a huge opportunity for Tesla. Estimates have priced their upcoming rigs in the ballpark of $170,000 at the low end to $200,000 at the higher end of the spectrum, and a number of other shipping companies are certainly intrigued by what Tesla is offering.
That said, the company has had problems delivering on demand in the consumer marketplace, and it’s hard to imagine that enterprise consumers would be as understanding if the same thing comes to pass with its big rigs.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $358.09 per share on Monday morning, up $6.04 (+1.72%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 15.01%, versus a 3.56% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-02-25,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Buyers To Lose Big EV Tax Cut In 2018,3,352.05,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-buyers-to-lose-big-ev-tax-cut/,"
A major reason for new car buyers to target Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) for the past few years has been the availability of massive electric vehicle tax kickbacks, but that key benefit looks set to run out very soon.more
As CNN Money reports, the EV maker informed the public that those lucrative vouchers won’t be around much longer:
In an SEC filing early Friday, Tesla said it expects that it will hit the threshold of 200,000 U.S. sales at some time in 2018. That will lead to the beginning of the end of a federal tax credit for its customers.
For any automaker, the full tax credit for their customers ends a few months after it sells its 200,000th plug-in car in the United States. Once the full tax credit disappears, for the next six months, buyers get a $3,750 credit. Then it drops to $1,875 during the following six months.
General Motors issued a similar warning last week as well, so Tesla isn’t alone here. It’ll be very interesting to see how this news affects demand for Tesla’s products — especially the new (and much-delayed) Model 3, which starts at just $35,000. If most Model 3 buyers won’t in fact see much of a tax credit, if any at all, it could well lead to a wave of order cancellations.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $352.05 on Friday, up $5.88 (+1.70%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 13.07%, versus a 2.94% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has made a ton of headway in the U.S. upper-sedan market in recent years, and the same now applies to the other side of the Atlantic. The company’s Tesla Model S has just checked a significant milestone off of the to-do list over in Europe.   more
Automotive News Europe passes along the details on Tesla’s success.
Germany’s premium brands are under pressure to accelerate their plans for electric cars after Tesla’s Model S outsold the luxury flagships of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi in Europe for the first time.
European sales of the Model S outstripped German premium brands’ range-topping sedans including the Mercedes S class and BMW 7 series.
Felipe Munoz, an analyst with JATO Dynamics, points to this news as “an alarm for the traditional automakers.” Consumers in Europe are showing increased interest in electric vehicles, and he worries that other companies are falling behind because they “can’t deliver on time.”
Last year, European sales of the Model S surged 30 percent to 16,132.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a ton of ambitious plans on its docket, including a goal of producing a battery-powered semi-truck for delivery next year. A rival automaker has thrown shade on those plans while contending that it has a more realistic timetable for an electric big rig of its own.  more
Automotive News has the news on Daimler AG’s plans.
Daimler AG cast doubt on Tesla Inc.’s plan to deliver electric heavy trucks next year, saying its more modest goal to start selling battery-powered big rigs by 2021 is more realistic.
Daimler, best known for its luxury cars, is also the world’s biggest truckmaker, giving Daimler the most to lose should Tesla boss Elon Musk succeed in producing a semi-truck with a 500-mile range for delivery starting in 2019.
Martin Daum, head of trucks at Daimler, announced plans for trials of electric Mercedes-Benz trucks this year. Daimler has its sights set on mass production of the semi-trucks in 2021.
He notes that timelines can’t be increased based on current battery technology, and that “the same laws of physics apply” at both Daimler and Tesla’s respective home bases in Germany and California.

Tesla increased the delivery wait times for new orders of both vehicles – claiming that high demand is creating a backlog.
The time between a new Model S or Model X order and delivery has always been fluctuating and it is dependent on the buyer locations.
Customers in the market for a Model S or Model X can anticipate a four to five month wait time. Earlier this month, the company announced that the Model X would be delivered in June 2018, and the Model S was designated with the same time frame yesterday.
The announcement of the delay has sparked some speculation that the delay could be the result of a production line update or a design refresh, but a company spokesperson has cited the backlog created by high demand for the vehicles.
Tesla Inc shares rose $1.90 (+0.57%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 7.05%, versus a 1.20% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #9 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.

2018-02-21,Hackers Hit Tesla Inc (TSLA) Cloud To Mine Cryptos,3,334.77,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-hackers-hit-tesla-inc-tsla-cloud-to-mine-cryptos/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the latest big name company to have been victimized by hackers, but it doesn’t appear that the intruders were looking for sensitive data or customer information. Instead, the hackers hopped on Tesla’s cloud while on a quest for crytocurrency. more
The Verge passes along the news on the recently-discovered breach.
Tesla’s cloud account was hacked and used to mine cryptocurrency, according to a security research firm. Hackers gained access to the electric car company’s Amazon cloud account, where they were able to view “sensitive data” such as vehicle telemetry.
The researchers, who work for cybersecurity firm RedLock, discovered the breach last month while searching for which organization left credentials for an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account open to the public internet. The owner turned out to be Tesla.
RedLock reached out to Tesla right away, and the situation was immediately rectified. A spokesperson for Tesla quickly noted that no sensitive information was compromised before they patched up the hole.
Gaurav Kumar, RedLock’s CTO, notes that it’s becoming “far more lucrative” for cybercriminals to focus on hijacking computing power as opposed to data.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $338.05 per share on Wednesday morning, up $3.28 (+0.98%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 8.58%, versus a 2.27% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-02-18,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model 3 Delays Spurring Brisk Chevy Bolt Sales,3,335.49,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-model-3-delays-spurring-brisk-chevy-bolt/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has created a vehicle in the Model 3 sedan that’s seeing no shortage of demand, but the fact that it simply can’t produce the car in any sort of mass quantities is giving its EV competitors a big advantage.more
As Reuters reports, would-be Tesla owners have taken to online forums to express their displeasure about repeated production delays, and GM dealers are reaping the benefits:
Last week Tesla told some holders of Model 3 reservations that they would not get their cars until 2019, eliciting howls of complaint on Tesla online fan forums. Tesla declined to comment.
GM dealers in California, the top U.S. market for electric vehicles, say brisk demand for Bolts is driven in part by frustrated Tesla buyers who are afraid they will lose a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit if they wait. The tax credit drops in value and eventually disappears once Tesla sells 200,000 electric vehicles in the United States, which Edmunds analyst Jeremy Acevedo expects Tesla to hit by the fall.
Customers reportedly are disenfranchised with the long wait time to get a Model 3, and they want an affordable electric vehicle now. GM has stepped up to fill that gap with the suddenly popular Chevy Bolt, an all-electric subcompact. While not as roomy as the Model 3, which is a mid-sized sedan, the vehicle offers just about everything else a modern EV buyer would want.
Pricing of the cars is nearly identical, as is their battery range. The one key difference is, you can walk into a dealership and drive home in a brand new Bolt today. If you want a Model 3, you’ll need to wait at least a year to get your car — and possibly much longer.
Tesla Inc shares closed at $335.49 on Friday, up $1.43 (+0.43%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 7.75%, versus a 2.34% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-02-16,Tesla Inc (TSLA) Continues To See Battery Traction With Public Utilities,3,334.07,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-tesla-inc-tsla-continues-to-see-battery-traction-with-public/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) appears set to strike a partnership with another public utility operator, this time in New York State.more
Teslarati has the details on a new proposal that would see a collaboration between Tesla and a key utility company that provides power to thousands of residents:
Orange and Rockland Utilities, a utility provider that is part of Consolidated Edison, Inc., recently submitted a proposal to collaborate with Tesla in the creation of a battery storage solution for New York residents. With the system in place, O&R expects its customers to see up to a 70% reduction in the demand charges on their electricity bills.
The Consolidated Edison utility provider submitted the proposal for the project on February 6 to the New York Public Service Commission. If the initiative does get approved, Tesla would be working closely with the utility provider to develop multi-use strategies that balance dispatch among stakeholder groups, including consumers who would be participating in the project.
O&R described exactly how the collaboration would work in a statement to the American Public Power Association. “These strategies will be guided by algorithms and protocols, designed by Tesla, to deliver optimal dispatch for the aggregated portfolio, maximizing the portfolio value among customers, the distribution grid, and Tesla. Under this demonstration, the flexible operating characteristics of distributed energy storage will be employed to obtain the highest value use of the resource at any point in time,” the organization noted.
Tesla has made significant progress with similar partnerships in Europe and Australia recently, particularly when pairing its batteries with green energy production like solar and wind power. The proposed collaboration between O&R and Tesla would earn some $788,000 annually, the organization noted, with 90% of those funds going to O&R and 10% going to Tesla.
Tesla Inc shares were trading at $334.70 per share on Friday morning, up $0.64 (+0.19%). Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 7.50%, versus a 2.23% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

2018-02-13,Bungled Model 3 Launch Leaves Door Open For Tesla Inc (TSLA) EV Competition,3,315.73,https://stocknews.com/news/tsla-bungled-model-3-launch-leaves-door-open-for-tesla-inc/,"
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) caused a major stir when it first announced a $35,000 electric vehicle packed with futuristic features.more
In fact, the Model 3 sedan has seen well over 500,000 pre-orders (which include a $1,000 refundable deposit) over the past year or so — despite the fact that almost no one has received their car yet.
Now, as Electrek reports, with the lower-priced configurations of the Model 3 still looking very far off, the door is open for competitors to step up and fill the void:
We have often discussed how electric cars in the $30,000 to $40,000 range weren’t on par with the Tesla Model 3, which led us to believe that those vehicles will have a tough time competing in the segment as the Model 3 becomes more widely available.
But with Tesla’s recent changes in the timeline for different and less expensive configurations, it has become clear that the Model 3 will not be available at a price point nowhere near $35,000 for almost the entire year, which could have a major impact in the EV market.
Potential alternatives to the Tesla Model 3 in the marketplace right now include the Chevy Bolt EV, the Hyundai Ioniq EV, and the new Nissan Leaf. The Leaf is expected to be available in higher volumes soon, and starts at $29,990 with a battery range of 151 miles.
The Leaf offers comparable options to the Model 3 that include Apple Carplay and Android Auto support, Alexa compatibility, a slick interface, and some autonomous driving features.
Tesla Inc shares were unchanged in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 1.41%, versus a -0.57% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of B (Buy), and is ranked #3 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.
